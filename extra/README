Snort++ Extras

Snort++ is all about plugins.  It has over 200 by default and makes it easy
to add more in C++ or LuaJIT.  This file will walk you through building and
running a set of extra example plugins.  If you haven't installed and
verified Snort++, you will need to do that first.  We will cover the
following topics:

* Overview
* Download
* Build Extras
* Run Extras
* Next Steps

OVERVIEW

The following things are pluggable in Snort++:

* codec - decode and encode support for a given protocol
* data - additional configuration for inspectors
* inspector - replaces Snort preprocessors
* ips_option - IPS rule option like content and byte_test
* ips_action - IPS rule action like alert and block
* search_engine - fast pattern matcher
* logger - event handers
* SO rules - dynamic rules

DOWNLOAD

There are two extra tarballs, one for autotools and one for cmake:

    snort_extra-1.0.0-a1-130-auto.tar.gz
    snort_extra-1.0.0-a1-130-cmake.tar.gz

If you cloned from github, you have already have everything.

BUILD EXTRAS

Follow these steps:

1.  Set up source directory:

* If you are using a github clone:

    cd extra/

* Otherwise do this:

    tar zxf extra-tarball
    cd snort_extra-1.0.0*

2.  Setup install path using pkgconfig (same as for snort):

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$my_path/lib/pkgconfig

3.  Compile and install:

* To build with autotools, simply do the usual from the top level directory:

    ./configure --prefix=$my_path
    make
    make install

* To build with cmake and make:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$my_path ..
    make
    make install

Note:

* If you are using autotools with a github clone, first do autoreconf -isvf.
* cmake --help will list any available generators, such as Xcode.  Feel
  free to use one, however help with those will be provided separately.
* each individual plugin directory is a standalone cmake project, and does
  not depend on any other part of the extra/ build tree

RUN EXTRAS

In the following, replace a.pcap with your favorite.

* The following demonstrates a C++ logger and a LuaJIT logger:

    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules \
        -r a.pcap --plugin-path $my_path/lib/snort_extra -A alert_ex

    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules \
        -r a.pcap --script-path $my_path/lib/snort_extra -A lualert

You can edit $my_path/lib/snort_extra/loggers/alert.lua to tweak the output
format and rerun the above command to try it out.

* The last example demonstrates a LuaJIT rule option called find.  The rule,
  supplied on stdin, uses the Lua [[ multiline string ]] delimiters to avoid
  shell escape issues:

    echo 'alert tcp any any -> any 80 ( sid:1; msg:"test"; http_method; find:"pat = [[GET]]"; )' | \
        $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r a.pcap \
            -A cmg --script-path $my_path/lib/snort_extra --stdin-rules

NEXT STEPS o")~

There is no design guide yet but you can develop your own plugins in C++ by
using the examples as a starting point.  In addition, IPS options and
loggers can also be written in LuaJIT.  The API may change going forward,
but you are encouraged to roll your own now and let us know how it goes so
we can incorporate any suggestions in the final design.
