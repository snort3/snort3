snort (2.9.3.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, target towards experimental due to the current freeze.
  * The most relevant change in this release is that support by Snort to
    output directly in a database has been dropped, which means that the
    snort-pgsql and snort-mysql packages are no longer possible. This 
    is documented in the NEWS file. Also relevant is that support for
    Prelude is no longer available.
  * Since this release does not include the snort database packages any
    longer, bugs associated with them are no longer relevant
    (Closes: #526511, #567495, #292699, #276565, #527113, #388963, #388962,
    #321046, #369951)
  * debian/rules: Update the configuration options to adjust to those used
    in the snort.conf script provided upstream
  * debian/patches/fix_upstream_typos: Do typo fixes to more source files
  * debian/patches/config: Add more comments in the default configuration
    file, enable at least one output plugin (unified2) and set some
    configurations values as recommended in Jason Weir's "Building a
    Debian\Snort based IDS" available in http://www.snort.org/docs
    (Closes: #193544)
  * debian/patches/*: Refresh the patches to apply to the new upstream release
  * debian/po/*: Refresh all templates since the previous templates for
    database configuration have gone along with the snort database 'flavor'
    packages.
  * debian/snort-common.preinst: Remove the /etc/snort/database.conf on
    upgrades
  * debian/snort.preinst: Control output of usermod
  * debian/snort-common.{config,templates}: 
      - Add code to detect old configuration files with content (which might
        happen on upgrades to 2.9.3 coming from the snort-mysql or snort-pgsql
        packages) and warn the user if they exist.
      - Update the list of valid preprocessors for this release

  [ Upload target towards Wheezy fixing some important bugs
    and substantially improving the information provided on the
    packages to clarify user expectations ]
  * Acknowledge previous NMU
  * debian/patches/config: Update the patch to: 
     - use absolute paths instead of relative paths to point to
       the white list and black list used by the reputation
       pre-processor.
     - disable the reputation as we do not ship any white/black lists
       by default (which causes it to fail at startup) and also
       because this preprocessor is experimental.

       Both changes fix the bug that prevented the package from being
       configured due to errors when starting up Snort with the 
       default configuration (Closes: #677810)

      - Add a comment to /etc/snort/snort.conf documenting for users
        reading the file that preinstalled rules are surely out of date.

  * debian/patches/config_disabled_rules: Comment out shellcode rules as these
    have a huge impact in performance unless properly tuned.
  * debian/patches/rules: Fix the definition of many SIP rules (defined
    as 'alert ip any any'. These were generating a lot of false positives
    in environment were enabled. Regardless of the change comment out SIP
    rules since they are outdate can generate many false alarms unless
    properly defined.  (Closes: #626596, #680303).
  * debian/control: Adjust description of snort-rules-default to indicate
    users that the ruleset provided should not be considered up-to-date.
    Encourage users to obtain additional/upgraded rules elsewhere.
  * debian/snort-rules-default.README.Debian: Include more information to
    potential users on the issues related to the default ruleset provided
    (and why it is out of date) as well as pointers as to where obtain
    additional rulesets. Some of this information is also in the NEWS file
    but is easy to miss to new users.

    the version of experimental was moved to the archive. 
     - Now /var/lib/snort is created through package configuration, as
       it should have been
     - Remove md5sum files when purging (Closes: #657038)
  * debian/rules: 
      - Enable IPv6 support which was optional in version 2.8 for the Snort
        binary package. This is not enabled for the database binary packages
        (snort-pgsql and snort-mysql) as the database schemas do not support
        IPv6.  (Closes: #633064) (LP: #703707)
      - Include the quilt makefile and add dependencies in -stamp and 
        clean targets
  * debian/snort.init.d: 
      - Do not abort if the package is not configured to use a database but
        the db-pending-config semaphore is found.  Remove it instead and
        continue. This can happen if a database-related package was installed,
        removed and then 'snort' is installed afterwards.

        (LP: #891904, #918250)
  * debian/snort-{mysql,pgsql}.postrm:
      - Remove the db-pending-config semaphore file when removing the package.
        This prevents errors with the snort.init.d logic if a database package
        is left unconfigured and then replaced with the snort (non-database)
        package.
  * debian/README-database.Debian: Indicate that database support will be
    deprecated in 2.9 and document that IPv6 is not supported either

      - Fix how the files are generated and use Perl instead of bash's echo
        as the latter will interpret content in the configuration file
        and will botch it
      - Fix typo in the configuration file which moved the configuration
        file to database.conf instead of just the database configuration.
      - Only generate content in database.conf if the default configuration
        file contains the DBSTART line from previous versions.
      - Be cautious, if an empty configuration file is generated then
        abort.
    (Closes: 607951)
  * debian/snort.preinst: Do not output information from usermod as this is
    not needed
  * Disable an error in rules/comunity-smtp.rules  that prevents snort from
    loading due to the use of !any (Closes: 607751)
  * debian/snort-{pgsql,mysql}.postinst: Fix syntax error in postinst scripts
    (Closes: 607678)

snort (2.8.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the database configuration code for the -mysql and -pgsql packages
    into an independent file (/etc/snort/database.conf). This prevents the
    debconf script from modifying /etc/snort/snort.conf, which is a conffile.
    And, consequentely, prevents upgrade prompts for users as well as some
    other issues when upgrading (Closes: #603428, #566308)
    * Adding snort-common-preinst to split off exiting config or touch the
      new database config file on new installations to ensure it exists.
    * Modify etc/snort.conf to include the new database configuration file.
    * Modify snort-{mysql,pgsql}.postinst to use new configuration file.
    * Modify snort-{mysql,pgsql,common}.postrm to purge new configuration file if
      it exists.
    Thanks to Alexander Reichle-Schmehl for the initial patch used to fix this issue
  * debian/NEWS: describe the new change on database handling
  * debian/snort{,-inline,-mysql,-pgsql}.prerm: Move the code in charge of killing
    snort astray children over to the proper location and also ignore errors 
    if there are (process might appear spurously in the process table due to
    race conditions) (Closes: 557729)

snort (2.9.0.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
  * Change configure.in to use 'dumbnet' instead of 'dnet' since the library
    is renamed in Debian
  * debian/control: 
       - Make it Build-Depend on libdumbnet-dev since this release now requires
         it (it was previously optional)
       - Remove iptables-dev (no longer required) (Closes: 634660)
  * debian/rules: 
        - Do not use --enable-smbalerts (no longer available) when configuring
  * Remove the following documentation from the installation as it is no longer
    available: doc/README.FLEXRESP, doc/README.FLEXRESP2

  * Upload to experimental until I get wider testing.

snort (2.8.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the reverse_order debconf option since Snort no longer supports the
    -o option. The default now in Snort is to have Pass|Alert|Log 
    (Closes: 565567)
  * Change error message in the init.d script to point to /var/log/daemon.log
    for Snort log messages.

snort (2.8.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 
     - Fixes CVE-2009-3641: possible DoS due to crafted IPv6 packet when
       then -v option is enabled
  * Fix src/snort.c since it is not buildable, it seems that the distributed
    source code has a bug.

snort (2.8.4.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package rebuild to fix libmysql depedency (Closes: #548831)
  * Remove use_static_footprint_sizes option from the stream5_tcp disassembler
    in etc/snort.conf as the use in production systems is actually discouraged

snort (2.8.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix init.d so that if 'restart' is executed when no instance is
    running (no pidfile) it will try to start all of instances, just
    if 'start' was executed. (Closes: #540450)
  * Add information on how the init.d script works (Closes: #512810)
  * Fix name of file in README-database.Debian, remove the database
    information from the main README.Debian file. (LP: #302218)
  * Fix bug in debian/clean-sources.sh script (Closes: #547316)
  * Use a patch provided by Dave Walker <DaveWalker_AT_ubuntu.com>
    to prevent starting snort-mysql|pgsql if the database is not configured 
    yet. This bug cannot be really fixed until we use dbconfig-common
    here to ask for all the database information to the user
    through Debconf. (LP: #222091) (Closes: #545082)

snort (2.8.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the log message in debian/snort.init.d so people are not led to
    believe they need a /etc/snort/snort.$iface.conf configuration file,
    /etc/snort/snort.conf is usually just fine.
  * Lintian fixes:
   - Fix long lines in changelog
   - Fix debconf priority in configuration scripts (error -> high)
   - Do not install README.WIN32 in snort-doc's documentation
   - Do not ignore errors on snort-rules-default.{postrm, preinst}

  * As acknowledged by upstream and confirmed by users, this release fixes a
    segfault in snort-mysql (Closes: 536144)
  * Updated Russian po-debconf translation provided by Yuri Kozlov 
    (Closes: 528677)
  * Change syslogd dependency in snort, snort-pgsql and snort-mysql to rsyslog 
    since that is the default syslog daemon now. (Closes: 526916)
  * Remove the syslog dependency from snort-common and snort-rules-default

snort (2.8.4.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
  * Only provided the latest release notes at debian/snort-common.docs, move
    older RELEASE notes to docs/
  * Update the doc list at debian/snort-doc.docs with the contents from
    doc/ (new READMEs). Add also the old RELEASE notes for reference.

snort (2.7.0-26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug in snort-pgsql and snort-mysql's configuration script introduced in
    the previous upload. They were using the wrong debconf keys which made
    maintainer scripts fail. (Closes: #526915)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Tue, 05 May 2009 01:29:37 +0200

snort (2.7.0-25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use src/output-plugins/spo_database.c from the 2.8.4.1 release. This
    version includes the necessary code to configure the mysql connection so
    that it reconnects to the database in case the connection gets lost. This
    might happen if too few events are logged in Snort and the database
    connection timeouts. (Closes: #449568) 
  * Copy over src/ipv6_port.h from 2.8.4.1 and include it in
    src/output-plugins/spo_database.c
  * Update Japanese translation for the templates, thanks to Hideki Yamane
    (Closes: 510704)
  * Move the code that detects if interfaces are down over to snort-pgsql and
    snort-mysql.  This way, if the interface defined is not available it will
    prompt again, raising the debconf priority (Closes: #502084) 
    (LP: #477590, #655116)
  * Change all the config_parameters debconf input from 'medium' to 'error'
  * Change all the needs_db_config debconf questions from 'medium' to 'high'
    since users that do not see this note will end up with a non-functioning
    package.

snort (2.7.0-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the LogMessage associated with fragmented traffic since it shows up
    even in systems that do not have ttl_limit set.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Feb 2009 13:03:22 +0100

snort (2.7.0-23) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix error in call to LogMessage (missing parameters) which caused a segfault
    when fragmented packages were received and ttl_limit was set.  This bug was
    introduced in the patch to fix CVE-2008-1804. Urgency set to 'high' as in
    some circunstances it makes Snort fail to start on startup or die after
    working for only a few minutes. Also, this could be used as a DoS attack
    against an IDS sensor rendering it useless.(Closes: 503992)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Feb 2009 12:11:33 +0100

snort (2.7.0-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include patch from dato to make the package binNMU-safe
  * Remove debian/CVS and debian/my/CVS
  * Fix bug in snort-stat that made it miss alerts generated by preprocessors (they only contain
    Priority) as well as fix the setting of $alert->{PRIORITY} for alerts
    generated by rules. Thanks for Gabor Gombas for the patch. (Closes: #500215)
  * Lintian fixes:
    - Use Standards Version 3.8.0, no changes needed.
    - Make snort-rules-default.postrm run with 'set +e' and append '|| true' to
      rmdir calls so that the script does not abort if the directories are not
      empty.

snort (2.7.0-20.3) testing-proposed-updates; urgency=low

  * Reupload to testing to *really* depend on newer libpcre.
  * Include patch from dato to make the package binNMU-safe
  * Remove debian/CVS and debian/my/CVS

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Tue, 04 Nov 2008 22:35:26 +0100

snort (2.7.0-20.2) testing-proposed-updates; urgency=high

  * Upload to testing-proposed-updates to fix security bug CVE-2008-1804 (see
    below). This package cannot go through sid since the sid build uses a
    newer libpcre version not available in lenny. (Closes: #483160)

snort (2.7.0-20) unstable; urgency=high

  [ CVE-2008-1804 ]
  * Fix error in preprocessors/spp_frag3.c that prevented Snort from properly
    identifying packet fragments that had dissimilar TTL values, which allowed
    remote attackers to bypass detection rules by using a different TTL for
    each fragment. Also update src/generators.h to include the new FRAG3_MIN_TTL
    defines (Closes: #483160)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 2008 01:33:34 +0200

snort (2.7.0-19) unstable; urgency=low

    - copyright file is now UTF-8
    - wrap around files in the changelog
    - remove empty /usr/src directory from snort-common-libraries
    - fix spelling error in NEWS file
    - fix manpage error in snort.8
    - change doc-base sections to Network/Monitoring

snort (2.7.0-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to Standards-Version 3.7.3:
    - Have the logrotate script call invoke-rc.d if available to do the 
    'right thing' if the admin has configured Snort to not run by default.
  * Copyright review:
     - Add copyright statements to the debian/copyright
     - Note that the Snort source code is distributed as GPL 2 only (not
     version 3)
     - Create a copyright_review.sh shell script to review the contents of
     the sources and find new copyright statements
     - Point in debian/copyright to the GPL-2 file, not to GPL (which is v3)
  * Expand brace-expanded content in debian/rules to prevent bashism 
    (Closes: #478627)
  * Modify the provided snort_rules_update to use oinkcodes, note
    in the script that the use of 'oinkmaster' should be preferred
    (Closes: 314483)
  * Remove Homepage: from binaries package when redundant with the
    source package.
  * Handle in the init.d script the case of interfaces being available
    but not up, thanks to Drew Parsons for an exhaustive analysis and
    patch (Closes: #471462)
  * Remove header files from the snort-common-libraries package. If users
    request it back I will create a snort-common-libraries-dev package
    providing these headers (Closes: 440842)
  * Database upgrade:
      - Added README-database-upgrade.Debian to describe the steps that
      need to be done to upgrade the Database, also update upstream's
      (cursory) documentation to describe the v107 changes (Closes: 445334)
      - [src/output-plugins/spo_database.c] Modify the text messages to 
      point users to the proper location of documentation in Debian
      systems as well as to the (Debian-specific) documentation 
      related to databases.
      - Tell users (through NEWS.Debian) that the schema changed from
      2.6 to 2.7 and they will need to upgrade their database.
  * Include the RELEASE NOTES for older releases and provide all of them
    (for the 2.3, 2.4, and 2.6 releases) as users might find them useful
    for upgrade purposes (Changelog might be too detailed)
  * Debconf templates and debian/control reviewed by the debian-l10n-
    english team as part of the Smith review project. Thanks to
    Christian Perrier for his hard work getting this done (Closes: #469803)

snort (2.7.0-14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Move installation of the snort.default file from the install-indep rule to
    the install rule. This error was preventing /etc/snort/default from being
    created in the Snort binary packages and, consequently, the init.d would
    fail to start properly and the package would not install (Closes: #471895,
    #473282)
  * Add libgnutls-dev Build-Depend (Closes: #476651)
  * Fix typo in the name of the community rules in snort.conf, thanks to
    David Gil for providing a patch (Closes: #470881)

snort (2.7.0-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the build: target be an empty one, instead of having it depend on
    both build-arch and build-indep
  * Remove texlive-latex-recommended from Build-Depends-Indep as suggested by
    James Vega

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Mar 2008 00:16:47 +0100

snort (2.7.0-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add texlive-latex-recommended to Build-Depends-Indep since refcount.sty
    and kvoptions.sty are used 
  * Have the binary-{arch,indep} depend on install-{arch,indep} instead
    of in the install target.
      - Move install calls related to snort-common to the install-indep target
  * Add some sty files to the build-indep checks in debian/rules so that the
    documentation is not compiled unless all are available. Yes, buildds are
    stupid enough to pre-install latex, make the previous checks insufficient
    and *still* call the build (not build-arch) target! (Closes: #445113)
  * Unindent comments in debian/rules so that they do not show up.

snort (2.7.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the init.d script not depend on the availability of iproute.
    (Closes: #463020, #466674) 
  * Added a Recommends on iproute, as it can be used to improve the
    behaviour of the initd script.
  * Modify the init.d script to remove also the lockfiles for PIDFILEs
  * Move snort-doc to Suggests in the snort package and add it to snort-pgsl
    and snort-mysql too.
  * Fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD (due to unsatisfied Build-Depends on
    iptables-dev), thanks to Petr Salinger for the fix (Closes: #466073)
  * Modify src/snort.c to prevent it from showing a message when it tries to
    remove the PIDFILE. This fails in Debian since Snort is not running 
    as the root user and the daemon cannot modify /var/run. The code is 
    changed so that the error message related to not being able to remove the
    PIDFILE is only presented if running as root or writing the PIDFILE to a
    directory that is not /var/run. (Closes: #462423)
  * Po-debconf translation updates:
      - Fix error in Italian translation (Closes: #462865)
      - Japanese translation update, provided by Hideki Yamane (Closes: #463650)

snort (2.7.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a new ALLOW_UNAVAILABLE definition in /etc/default/snort which
    makes the init.d not complain if a configured interface is not available.
    Also make the init.d script not break if no instances are configured
    through debconf (to make it possible to use snort using just if-up.d
    by providing a given interface instance as a 'start' parameter)
    (Closes: #458823)
  * Fix typo in templates, unfuzzy translations I can "understand" and
    which seem to have fixed the typo themselves.
  * Po-debconf updates:
    - Update German translation provided by Erik Schanze (Closes: #462674)
    - Updated Italian translation provided by Gianluca Cotr (Closes: #462865)

  * Modify debian/rules to prevent autobuilders from building 
    the binary-independent components: (Closes: #445113)
    (Thanks dato for the tip)
     * Create a new Build-Depends-Indep with all the TeX components used
       to build documentation
     * Since autobuilders call build, which in turns calls build-indep, hack
       the debian rules file so that the documentation is only built
       if ps2pdf, dvips and pslatex are available. 
  * Enable prelude support in all variants (Closes: #458790)

snort (2.7.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrite debian/rules:
      - the documentation does not get build on the binary-arch target,
      (Closes: #445113) 
      - there is now a install-dep and install-arch
      - install-* dependencies do not depend on build
      - create a 'clean-sources' target, used only by the 'clean' target
      - create a clean_sources.sh script to clean the sources properly before
        each run
      - call 'clean_sources.sh' before a binary (pgsql, mysql...) is built to
        prevent the binary-* rule from calling 'distclean' at the end of each
        run (and thus making issues more difficult to debug)
      - generate a configure target and use it when building both -arch
        and -indep (needed to generate doc/Makefile)
      - copy, instead of moving, the binaries, so the 'install' target 
        is more idempotent (still have to use dh_install more to make it so)
  * Change Maintainer's email address
  * Create a mechanism to generate all the templates using a "template of
    templates" since all the questions where the same with small differences
    per package.
      - Also fixed snort-inline templates, which were not correct (pointed
        to the wrong configuration file)
      - Update Spanish translation myself
  * Change the init.d script so it behaves like LSB demands:
      - Do not exit with error if there are no running instances and we
        try to stop
      - With 'status', exit with a 1/3 error based on the existence (or not
        of the pidfiles)
      - Dot not exit with error when trying to start an instance that is
        already started (use running() for that)
      - Check if the user is root before attempting to star/stop/restart
      - Adjust to LSB exit values (instead of just using always '1', use
        3-6 to indicate several different errors)
  * Lintian cleanup:
      - Move Homepage: from the description to a pseudo-header in
      debian/control
      - do not ignore distclean errors
      - remove call to dh_suidregister, we did not use it
      - add DEBHELPER token to snort-common.postinst
      - update config.guess and config.sub with automake's 1.7 versions
        (this is not done automatically in the package, however)
      - replace ${Source-Version} substvar with ${binary:version}
      - Move the configuration check of snort-common over to the config
        script and leave the postinst only to check the status of the
        init.d script. Also, modify the snort-common.postinst so it only
        does the configuration check if invoke-rc.d (if installed)
      - Fix 'malformed-title-in-templates' in all templates by removing
        the ending dot
      - Fix the 'malformed-prompt-in-templates' by adjusting the contents
        of all the titles affected
      - Shorten the length of the 'interface' template
      - Fix syntax on debian/NEWS
      - Remove empty dirs

snort (2.7.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #435417, #404991, #320920, #323985)
     - Fixes DOS attack: CVE-2006-6931 - "Backtracking Algorithmic Complexity"
       DoS against IDS engine (Closes: #407421)
  * Introduce all the rules available from the 2.4 release which are GPL and
    are non-VRT certified, that is, all rules which are outside of the range
    [3,465-1,000,000]. This amounts to a total of 3935 rules (820 of which are
    Community released).
  * In order to handle rulesets with mixed GPL and non-GPL rules two scripts
    have been made available in the source rules/ subdirectory:
        - remove-non-gpl.pl - Given a rules file removes all rules outside
          the above range
        - purge-non-gpl.sh - Given a directory dumps on the local directory
          only rules outside this range.
    In order to limit maintainer overhead the header for modified rulesets has
    not been changed.
  * Include the VRT license file. This file is kept for reference under the
    rules/ dir, although *no* rule in this package is under that non-free license.
  * Include a NEWS.Debian item describing the license change and the rules
    distributed within this package.
    not in the database packages (Closes: #320920)
  * As a consequence of the above Build-Depend on libprelude-dev, iptables-dev
  * Provide support for Prelude in both snort and snort-inline packages but
  * The examples are now included in the -common package instead of having
    them  in all the binary packages

  This package provides support to make an experimental separate binary
  package for inline support: snort-inline, which most of the configuration is
  shared with the snort binary package but the PPP related options have been
  removed. However, snort-inline does not support libnet 1.1 so we cannot
  provide it yet. This has been changed in Snort's code but it's far from
  complete:
       - Make the configure script work with libnet 1.1. 
       - Port parts of the API (some declarations) to 1.1

snort (2.3.3-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix security issue CVE-2006-2769, potential evasion in URI content
    buffers. This evasion only applies to Apache protected servers since
    that server supports some characters. The patch used is from 2.4.5
    and is *not* the one provided by Demarc (which is not fully
    comprehensive and is much more intrusive).
    Since this is an evasion issue and not a real security issue 
    thus the 'medium' urgency even though it fixes security bug (Closes:
    #381726)

    From upstream (snort.org webpage, News item "Possible Evasion in
    http_inspect"): 

     «The Apache web server supports special characters in HTTP requests that
     do not affect the processing of the particular request. The current
     target-based profiles for Apache in the http_inspect preprocessor do not
     properly handle these requests, resulting in the possibility that an
     attacker can bypass detection of rules that use the "uricontent" keyword
     by embedding special characters in a HTTP request.»

     «It is important to note that this is an evasion and not a vulnerability.
     This means that while it is possible for an attacker to bypass detection,
     Snort sensors and the networks they protect are not at a heightened risk
     of other attacks.»

  * Backport fix of another (different) potential evasion in Stream4 (also in
    the Snort 2.4.5 release, no CVE name)
  * Relocate Czech translation, it was not under debian/po
  * Add a warning in /etc/default/snort that the SNORT_USER will be 
    modified (with usermod) every time you reinstall the package
    (don't change it to 'root'!)

    still keeping the coreutils | fileutils dependency since I still want to
    compile this package in woody.(Closes: #365874)
  * Also remove DH_COMPAT from debian/rules as suggested by  Stefan Huehner in

  * Move 'debian/my/lisapaper.txt' to snort-doc.docs and remove from snort,
    snort-pgsql and snort-mysql doc files (Closes: #340091)

  * Updated Build-Dependencies to use libmysqlclient15-dev instead of the 
    old libmysqlclient10 library (Closes: #356706)
  * Add a 'DEBIAN_SNORT_SEND_STATS' option (controlled by debconf) to allow
    users to define if snort should send daily stats. Users that want to
    change the frequency should manually move over the cron.daily script
    to other cron.XXX locations (Closes: #353035)
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Dutch translation with patch provided by Peter Vandenabeele
    - Spanish Debconf translation ('send_stats' template)
  * Do not indent '@' in the e-mail of users that receive the stats (Closes: #335803)
  * Preliminary code (only in snort.config) to detect if the default interface
    is up when configuring Snort, the Debconf question priority is raised if
    the interface is not up or it does not exist and the user is pestered
    if he still provides an invalid answer (unless he doesn't see the
    question, which is the case if running with debconf priority set to
    'high', in this case, we bail out)
    Note: will introduce this in the DB packages after it gets some testing
    out there.
  * Change the Debconf priority of the note that warns that  the configuration
    is not working to 'critical' (was 'high')
  * Acknowledge NMU made by Margarita:

        Thanks A Hernandez for the find.
    (Closes: #328134)
    Note: This is a "security" bug but no CVE is assigned, it is actually
    something that can happen only if a Snort user willingly shoots himself
    on the foot (uses ASCII logging mode) or if he uses the fast output
    mode with some non-default options.

snort (2.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  (First attempt at experimental, to avoid breaking installations running sid)
  * New upstream release 
  * This version now uses libnet1, changed Build-Depends (Closes: #241995)
  * Introduced /etc/default/snort and removed /etc/snort/common.parameters
    this makes it easier to check for common situations (parsing the parameter
    file is quite complicated). The old common.parameters file is moved
    over to /etc/default/snort automatically, but retained in case
    the parsing has not been done properly (and will not be used until
    the common.parameters file is removed). This is described in the
    NEWS.Debian file.
  * Fixed the postint call so that the passwd and group are checked before
    they are created. Also fix chown call (still used '.' instead of ':')
  * Introduce a check for the status of Snort's logdirectory, it checks if
    it belongs to Snort (Closes: #247603)
  * This release provides debconf support for snort sensors in 
    multiple interfaces (Closes: #283816)
  * Run update-debconf, seems I had not done this when I last made changes
    in the templates in 2.2.0-8
  * Included the documentation available, including signatures. Also
    added the LaTeX manual included as well as the additional Build-Depends
    on tetex-bin and gs-common
  * Updated the FAQ (was about time!) from http://www.snort.org/docs/FAQ.txt
  * Added a README.docs file (pointing people to more documents)
  * Updated translations:
    - German, provided by Erik Schanze (Closes: #289405)

snort (2.2.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed old (obsolete) converstion of PPPENV in /var/tmp in postinst
    which actually might open up security holes when using dialup access
    and installing/upgrading the package.
  * Updated translations:
    - Japanese, provided by Hideki Yamane (closes: #283128)
    - French, provided by Christian Perrier (closes: #284559)

snort (2.2.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the README.Debian file with proper information on how to setup
    multiple interfaces and rewrote the Debconf question to specify that
    it can be used to define multiple interfaces (Closes: #283816) 
  * Added some additional TODO notes

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Wed,  1 Dec 2004 17:04:38 +0100

snort (2.2.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make snort-common Arch: all (Closes: #278987) 
  * The installation will now check if you are using a configuration that
    will not be able to work with the current Snort version and will forewarn
    you. The package installation will still fail (if Snort is started
    automatically) but the administrator will be pointed to where the
    error is (Closes: #165107)
  * Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages and provide proper
    PACKAGE.manpages file since dh_installmanpages now fails to create the
    snort-common package properly.
  * Updated to the latest rules snapshot
  * Added an 'update-rules' target in debian/rules that downloads the 
    latest rules snapshot and installs it in the package.
  [ Translations ]
  * Dutch update, provided by cobaco (Closes: #278719)

snort (2.2.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a 'config-check' option in init.d to test the user's configuration
    file. This could be used to determine (in postinst) if snort should be
    restarted and warn the user (not yet done). This will help fix #165107,
    #165351 (since similar user mistakes would be detected), #276565 and
    #247665.
  * Added more information to the TODOs
  * Moved DEBIAN_TRESHOLD to DEBIAN_THRESHOLD (save for the debconf value
    in order to avoid reseting it) (Closes: #256581)
  * Removed double space in template (Closes: #275936)
  * The snort-rules package now Suggests: snort instead of depending on it
    (Closes: #249697)
  * Updated rules with the latest snapshot.

snort (2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added config-file discovery to ppp init.scripts so that Snort is
    started (-c) with the proper configuration file if available or 
    snort.conf if not. Setting high severity so that users running
    Snort with PPP don't end up with a full /var filesystem (Closes: #268707)
  * Fixed bashism in /etc/ppp/if-up.d/snort
  * Modified the init.d an if-up.d scripts so that
    /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters is only used if it exists.
  * Snort-rules-default now Recommends: oinkmaster 
    now that it is in the archive (accepted 01 Oct 2004), this does not
    close #191105 since IMHO a better signature update mechanism should 
    be introduced. Also updated the related TODO item.
  * Added a FAQ Q&A regarding rule updates in README.Debian
  * Added code to detect for deprecated preprocessors and warn the user,
    curretnly the code will not touch the configuration files himself and
    will not detect if you are using the standard package configuration file.
    It will prevent users from having configuration issues, however
    (Closes: #247665)
  * Modified the init.d file so you can use 'status' to determine if
    the Snort sensors are up or not.
  * Updated the 2.2 rule set with the snapshot provided at snort.org, new rules
    include detection of the recent JPEG exploit (Closes: #274244)
  * Fixed typo in templates (unfuzzied modified entries) and updated
    JA translation provided by Hideki Yamane (Closes: #273138)

snort (2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  ! Once again: Thanks Mario 'BitKoenig' Holbe for your great help:
    + Moved 'dialup' interface guessing from ppp/ip-up to postinst
  + Cleanup restart: only restart current running interfaces
    This also cleans up: 'dialup' logcheck failure, if no snort running
  + Prepare for multisensor support
  + Use start-stop-daemon --retry instead of sleep and kill -9
  + Use invoke-rc.d only, if it exists
    Closes: #191574
  + Correct please_restart to please_restart_manually
  + Re-Unified prerm and postinst scripts
  + Fix the backward-compatible just-kill-them-all in prerm;
    do we really need it? It definitely didn't work before and
    since the old-package prerm is called anyways, we shouldn't.
  + Simplify snort.debian.conf creation

  + snort-doc/examples now has a snort-rules auto-update script!
    Closes: #242521, thanks Marcel!
  + Updated fr.po by Christian Perrier
    Closes: #244048, thanks Christian!
  + Recent changes to init / ip-{up,down} scripts fixed this bug:
    Closes: #226236
  + Fixed database schema's in {pg,my}sql packages. This does not fix
    the 'schema is not installed when debconf prompts for it'-problem.
    Closes: #244017
  + Problem with snort-pgsql.template fixed.

      * Snort group is now created using --system in all packages
        Closes: #231580
      * Both the cron.daily script and the postinst scripts set a default
        value for STATS_RCPT and STATS_TRESHOLD to avoid buggy behaviours
        if the user does not setup a proper value when interfacing with
        debconf. Still, these values should be checked in the config 
        scripts. (Closes: #173331)
      * Snort-stat now exists if there are no results which will avoid
        it from sending empty emails 
        (Closes: #217913, #174508, #192401, #172529)
      * Improved the explanations in several templates (Closes: #217173)
      * Updated Japanese translation (and fixed some po format errors,
        hopefully without damaging the po file) (Closes: #226680)
      * Included Catalan debconf translation (Closes: #236644)
      * Updated pt-BR debconf translation (Closes: #228244)
      * Re-Added (partial) spanish debconf translation (it seems that 
        the work I did back in december 2001 has not been moved to po-debconf!)

    + Closes: #134063
