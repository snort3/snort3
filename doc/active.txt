Snort can take more active role in securing network by sending active
responses to shutdown offending sessions. When active responses is
enabled, snort will send TCP RST or ICMP unreachable when dropping a
session.

==== Changes from Snort 2.9

* stream5_global:max_active_responses and min_response_seconds are now
active.max_responses and active.min_interval.

* Response actions were removed from IPS rule body to the rule action
in the header.  This includes react, reject, and rewrite (split out of 
replace which now just does the detection part). These IPS actions are
plugins.

* drop and block are synonymous in Snort 2.9 but in Snort 3.0 drop means
don't forward the current packet only whereas block means don't forward
this or any following packet on the flow.

==== Configure Active

Active response is enabled by configuring one of following IPS action 
plugins:

    react = { }
    reject = { }
    rewrite = { }

Active responses will be performed for reject, react or rewrite IPS rule 
actions, and response packets are encoded based on the triggering packet. 
TTL will be set to the value captured at session pickup.

Configure the number of attempts to land a TCP RST within the session's 
current window (so that it is accepted by the receiving TCP).  This
sequence "strafing" is really only useful in passive mode.  In inline mode 
the reset is put straight into the stream in lieu of the triggering packet 
so strafing is not necessary.

Each attempt (sent in rapid succession) has a different sequence number. 
Each active response will actually cause this number of TCP resets to be 
sent. TCP data is multiplied similarly. At most 1 ICMP unreachable is sent,
iff attempts > 0.

     
Device IP will perform network layer injection.  It is probably a better 
choice to specify an interface and avoid kernel routing tables, etc.

dst_mac will change response destination MAC address, if the device is 
eth0, eth1, eth2 etc. Otherwise, response destination MAC address is 
derived from packet.

Example:

    active =
    {
        attempts = 2,
        device = "eth0",
        dst_mac = "00:06:76:DD:5F:E3",
    }


==== Reject

IPS action reject perform active response to shutdown hostile network 
session by injecting TCP resets (TCP connections) or ICMP unreachable 
packets.

Example:

    reject = { reset = "both", control = "all" }

    local_rules =
    [[
    reject tcp ( msg:"hostile connection"; flow:established, to_server;
    content:"HACK!"; sid:1; )
    ]]

    ips =
    {
        rules = local_rules,
    }


==== React

IPS action react enables sending an HTML page on a session and then 
resetting it.

The page to be sent can be read from a file:

    react = { page = "custmized_block_page.html", }

or else the default is used:

    <default_page> ::= \
        "HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\n"
        "Connection: close\r\n"
        "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n"
        "\r\n"
        "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN\"\r\n" \
        "    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd\">\r\n" \
        "<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" 
        xml:lang=\"en\">\r\n" \
        "<head>\r\n" \
        "<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; 
        charset=UTF-8\" />\r\n" \
        "<title>Access Denied</title>\r\n" \
        "</head>\r\n" \
        "<body>\r\n" \
        "<h1>Access Denied</h1>\r\n" \
        "<p>%s</p>\r\n" \
        "</body>\r\n" \
        "</html>\r\n";

Note that the file must contain the entire response, including any HTTP 
headers. In fact, the response isn't strictly limited to HTTP.  You could 
craft a binary payload of arbitrary content. 

When the rule is configured, the page is loaded and the %s is replaced 
with the selected message, which defaults to:

        "You are attempting to access a forbidden site.<br />" \
        "Consult your system administrator for details."

Additional formatting operators beyond a single %s are prohibited, 
including %d, %x, %s, as well as any URL encodings such as as %20 (space) 
that may be within a reference URL.

Example:

    react = { page = "my_block_page.html" }

    local_rules =
    [[
    react http ( msg:"Unauthorized Access Prohibited!"; flow:established, 
    to_server; http_method; content:"GET"; sid:1; )
    ]]

    ips =
    {
        rules = local_rules,
    }

==== Rewrite

IPS action rewrite enables overwrite packet contents based on "replace" 
option in the rules.

For example:

    rewrite = { }
    local_rules =
    [[
    rewrite tcp 10.1.1.87 any -> 10.1.1.0/24 80
    (
        sid:1000002;
        msg:"test replace rule";
        content:"index.php", nocase;
        replace:"indax.php";
    )
    ]]

    ips =
    {
        rules = local_rules,
    }

this rule replaces "index.php" with "indax.php", and rewrite action 
updates that packet.

to enable rewrite action:

    rewrite = { }

the replace operation can be disabled by changing the configuration:

    rewrite = { disable_replace = true }
