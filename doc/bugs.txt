==== Build

* Enabling large pcap may erroneously affect the number of packets processed
  from pcaps.

* Enabling debug messages may erroneously affect the number of packets
  processed from pcaps.

* Building with clang and autotools on Linux will show the following
  warning many times.  Please ignore.

    clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pthread'


==== Config

* Parsing issue with IP lists.  can't parse rules with $EXTERNAL_NET
  defined as below because of the space between ! and 10.

    HOME_NET = [[ 10.0.17.0/24 10.0.14.0/24 10.247.0.0/16 10.246.0.0/16 ]]
    EXTERNAL_NET = '! ' .. HOME_NET

* Multiple versions of luajit scripts are not handled correctly.  The
  first loaded version will always be executed even though plugin manager
  saves the correct version.

* When using -c and -L together, the last on the command line wins (-c -L
  will dump; -L -c will analyze).

* Modules instantiated by command line only will not get default settings
  unless hard-coded.  This notably applies to -A and -L options.

* --lua can only be used in addition to, not in place of, a -c config.
  Ideally, --lua could be used in lieu of -c.


==== Rules

* metdata:service foo; metadata:service foo; won't cause a duplicate service
  warning as does metadata:service foo, service foo;

* ip_proto doesn't work properly with reassembled packets so it can't be
  used to restrict the protocol of service rules.


==== snort2lua

* uricontent:"foo"; content:"bar"; -> http_uri; content:"foo"; content:"bar";
  (missing pkt_data)

* stream_tcp ports and protocols both go into a single binder.when; this is
  incorrect as the when fields are logically anded together (ie must all be
  true). Should create 2 separate bindings.

* There is a bug in pps_stream_tcp.cc.. when stream_tcp: is specified
  without any arguments, snort2lua doesn't convert it.  Same for
  stream_udp.

* Loses the ip list delimiters [ ]; change to ( )

    in snort.conf: var HOME_NET [A,B,C]
    in snort.lua: HOME_NET = [[A B C]]

* Won't convert packet rules (alert tcp etc.) to service rules (alert http
  etc.).

* alert_fast and alert_full: output configuration includes "file =
  'foo.bar'", but file is a bool and you cannot specify an output file name
  in the configuration.

==== Runtime

* -B <mask> feature does not work. It does ordinary IP address obfuscation
  instead of using the mask.

* Obfuscation does not work for csv format.

* The hext DAQ will append a newline to text lines (starting with '"').

* The hext DAQ does not support embedded quotes in text lines (use hex
  lines as a workaround).

* stream_tcp alert squash mechanism incorrectly squashes alerts for
  different TCP packets.
