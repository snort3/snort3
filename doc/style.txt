All new code should try to follow these style guidelines.  These are not
yet firm so feedback is welcome to get something we can live with.

=== General

* Generally try to follow
  http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml, 
  but there are some differences documented here.

* Each source directory should have a dev_notes.txt file summarizing the
  key points and design decisions for the code in that directory.  These
  are built into the developers guide.

* Makefile.am and CMakeLists.txt should have the same files listed in alpha
  order.  This makes it easier to maintain both build systems.

* All new code must come with unit tests providing 95% coverage or better.

* Generally, Catch is preferred for tests in the source file and CppUTest
  is preferred for test executables in a test subdirectory.

=== C++ Specific

* Do not use exceptions.  Exception-safe code is non-trivial and we have
  ported legacy code that makes use of exceptions unwise.  There are a few
  exceptions to this rule for the memory manager, shell, etc.  Other code
  should handle errors as errors.

* Do not use dynamic_cast or RTTI.  Although compilers are getting better
  all the time, there is a time and space cost to this that is easily
  avoided.

* Use smart pointers judiciously as they aren't free.  If you would have to
  roll your own, then use a smart pointer.  If you just need a dtor to
  delete something, write the dtor.

* Prefer 'and' over && and 'or' over || for new source files.

* Use nullptr instead of NULL.

* Use new, delete, and their [] counterparts instead of malloc and free
  except where realloc must be used.  But try not to use realloc.  New and
  delete can't return nullptr so no need to check.  And Snort's memory
  manager will ensure that we live within our memory budget.

* Use references in lieu of pointers wherever possible.

* Use the order public, protected, private top to bottom in a class
  declaration.

* Keep inline functions in a class declaration very brief, preferably just
  one line.  If you need a more complex inline function, move the
  definition below the class declaration.

* The goal is to have highly readable class declarations.  The user
  shouldn't have to sift through implementation details to see what is
  available to the client.

* Any using statements in source files should be added only after all
  includes have been declared.

=== Naming

* Use camel case for namespaces, classes, and types like WhizBangPdfChecker.

* Use lower case identifiers with underscore separators, e.g. some_function()
  and my_var.

* Do not start or end variable names with an underscore.  This has a good
  chance of conflicting with macro and/or system definitions.

* Use lower case filenames with underscores.

=== Comments

* Write comments sparingly with a mind towards future proofing.  Often the
  comments can be obviated with better code.  Clear code is better than a
  comment.

* Heed Tim Ottinger's Rules on Comments (https://disqus.com/by/tim_ottinger/):

    1. Comments should only say what the code is incapable of saying.
    2. Comments that repeat (or pre-state) what the code is doing must be
       removed.
    3. If the code CAN say what the comment is saying, it must be changed at
       least until rule #2 is in force.

* Function comment blocks are generally just noise that quickly becomes
  obsolete.  If you absolutely must comment on parameters, put each on a
  separate line along with the comment.  That way changing the signature
  may prompt a change to the comments too.

* Use FIXIT (not FIXTHIS or TODO or whatever) to mark things left for a
  day or even just a minute.  That way we can find them easily and won't
  lose track of them.

* Presently using FIXIT-X where X = A | W | P | H | M | L, indicating analysis,
  warning, perf, high, med, or low priority.  Place A and W comments on the
  exact warning line so we can match up comments and build output.  Supporting
  comments can be added above.

* Put the copyright(s) and license in a comment block at the top of each
  source file (.h and .cc).  Don't bother with trivial scripts and make
  foo.  Some interesting Lua code should get a comment block too.  Copy and
  paste exactly from src/main.h (don't reformat).

* Put author, description, etc. in separate comment(s) following the
  license.  Do not put such comments in the middle of the license foo.
  Be sure to put the author line ahead of the header guard to exclude them
  from the developers guide.  Use the following format, and include a
  mention to the original author if this is derived work:

    // ips_dnp3_obj.cc author Maya Dagon <mdagon@cisco.com>
    // based on work by Ryan Jordan

* Each header should have a comment immediately after the header guard to
  give an overview of the file so the reader knows what's going on.

* Use the following comment on switch cases that intentionally fall through
  to the next case to suppress compiler warning on known valid cases:

    // fallthrough

=== Logging

* Messages intended for the user should not look like debug messages. Eg,
  the function name should not be included.  It is generally unhelpful to
  include pointers.

* Most debug messages should just be deleted.

* Don't bang your error messages (no !).  The user feels bad enough about the
  problem already w/o you shouting at him.

=== Types

* Use logical types to make the code clearer and to help the compiler catch
  problems.  typedef uint16_t Port; bool foo(Port) is way better than
  int foo(int port).

* Use forward declarations (e.g. struct SnortConfig;) instead of void*.

* Try not to use extern data unless absolutely necessary and then put the
  extern in an appropriate header.  Exceptions for things used in exactly
  one place like BaseApi pointers.

* Use const liberally.  In most cases, const char* s = "foo" should be
  const char* const s = "foo".  The former goes in the initialized data
  section and the latter in read only data section.

* But use const char s[] = "foo" instead of const char* s = "foo" when
  possible.  The latter form allocates a pointer variable and the data
  while the former allocates only the data.

* Use static wherever possible to minimize public symbols and eliminate
  unneeded relocations.

* Declare functions virtual only in the parent class introducing the
  function (not in a derived class that is overriding the function).
  This makes it clear which class introduces the function.

* Declare functions as override if they are intended to override a
  function.  This makes it possible to find derived implementations that
  didn't get updated and therefore won't get called due a change in the
  parent signature.

* Use bool functions instead of int unless there is truly a need for
  multiple error returns.  The C-style use of zero for success and -1 for
  error is less readable and often leads to messy code that either ignores
  the various errors anyway or needlessly and ineffectively tries to do
  something about them.  Generally that code is not updated if new errors
  are added.

=== Macros (aka defines)

* In many cases, even in C++, use #define name "value" instead of a
  const char* const name = "value" because it will eliminate a symbol from
  the binary.
  
* Use inline functions instead of macros where possible (pretty much all
  cases except where stringification is necessary).  Functions offer better
  typing, avoid re-expansions, and a debugger can break there.

* All macros except simple const values should be wrapped in () and all
  args should be wrapped in () too to avoid surprises upon expansion.
  Example:

    #define SEQ_LT(a,b)  ((int)((a) - (b)) <  0)

* Multiline macros should be blocked (i.e. inside { }) to avoid if-else type
  surprises.

=== Formatting

* Try to keep all source files under 2500 lines.  3000 is the max allowed.
  If you need more lines, chances are that the code needs to be refactored.

* Indent 4 space chars ... no tabs!

* If you need to indent many times, something could be rewritten or
  restructured to make it clearer.  Fewer indents is generally easier to
  write, easier to read, and overall better code.

* Braces go on the line immediately following a new scope (function
  signature, if, else, loop, switch, etc.

* Use consistent spacing and line breaks.  Always indent 4 spaces from the
  breaking line.  Keep lines less than 100 chars; it greatly helps
  readability.

    No:
        calling_a_func_with_a_long_name(arg1,
                                        arg2,
                                        arg3);

    Yes:
        calling_a_func_with_a_long_name(
            arg1, arg2, arg3);

* Put function signature on one line, except when breaking for the arg
  list:

    No:
        inline
        bool foo()
        { // ...

    Yes:
        inline bool foo()
        { // ...

* Put conditional code on the line following the if so it is easy to break
  on the conditional block:

  No:
      if ( test ) foo();

  Yes:
      if ( test )
          foo();

=== Headers

* Don't hesitate to create a new header if it is needed.  Don't lump
  unrelated stuff into an header because it is convenient.

* Write header guards like this (leading underscores are reserved for
  system stuff).  In my_header.h:

    #ifndef MY_HEADER_H
    #define MY_HEADER_H
    // ...
    #endif

* Includes from a different directory should specify parent directory.
  This makes it clear exactly what is included and avoids the primordial
  soup that results from using -I this -I that -I the_other_thing ... .

    // given:
    src/foo/foo.cc
    src/bar/bar.cc
    src/bar/baz.cc

    // in baz.cc
    #include "bar.h"

    // in foo.cc
    #include "bar/bar.h"

* Includes within installed headers should specify parent directory.

* Just because it is a #define doesn't mean it goes in a header.
  Everything should be scoped as tightly as possible.  Shared
  implementation declarations should go in a separate header from the
  interface.  And so on.

* All .cc files should include config.h with the standard block shown below
  immediately following the initial comment blocks and before anything else.
  This presents a consistent view of all included header files as well as
  access to any other configure-time definitions. No .h files should include
  config.h unless they are guaranteed to be local header files (never
  installed).

    #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
    #include "config.h"
    #endif

* A .cc should include its own .h before any others aside from the
  aforementioned config.h (including system headers).  This ensures that the
  header stands on its own and can be used by clients without include
  prerequisites and the developer will be the first to find a dependency issue.

* Split headers included from the local directory into a final block of
  headers.  For a .cc file, the final order of sets of header includes should
  look like this:

    1. config.h
    2. its own .h file
    3. system headers (.h/.hpp/.hxx)
    4. C++ standard library headers (no file extension)
    5. Snort headers external to the local directory (path-prefixed)
    6. Snort headers in the local directory

* Include required headers, all required headers, and nothing but required
  headers.  Don't just clone a bunch of headers because it is convenient.

* Keep includes in alphabetical order.  This makes it easier to maintain, avoid
  duplicates, etc.

* Do not put using statements in headers unless they are tightly scoped.

=== Warnings

* With g++, use at least these compiler flags:

    -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Wformat -Wformat-security
    -Wunused-but-set-variable -Wno-deprecated-declarations
    -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer

* With clang, use at least these compiler flags:

    -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Wformat -Wformat-security
    -Wno-deprecated-declarations
    -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer

* Two macros (PADDING_GUARD_BEGIN and PADDING_GUARD_END) are provided by
  utils/cpp_macros.h.  These should be used to surround any structure used as
  a hash key with a raw comparator or that would otherwise suffer from
  unintentional padding.  A compiler warning will be generated if any structure
  definition is automatically padded between the macro invocations.

* Then Fix All Warnings and Aborts.  None Allowed.

=== Uncrustify

Currently using uncrustify from at https://github.com/bengardner/uncrustify
to reformat legacy code and anything that happens to need a makeover at
some point.

The working config is crusty.cfg in the top level directory.  It does well
but will munge some things.  Specially formatted INDENT-OFF comments were
added in 2 places to avoid a real mess.

You can use uncrustify something like this:

    uncrustify -c crusty.cfg --replace file.cc
