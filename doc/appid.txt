Network administrators need application awareness in order to fine tune
their management of the ever-growing number of applications passing traffic
over the network. Application awareness allows an administrator to create
rules for applications as needed by the business. The rules can be used to
take action based on the application, such as block, allow or alert.

==== Overview

The AppId inspector provides an application level view when managing
networks by providing the following features:

* Network control: The inspector works with Snort rules by providing a set of
  application identifiers (AppIds) to Snort rule writers.

* Application usage awareness: The inspector outputs statistics to show
  how many times applications are being used on the network.

* Custom applications: Administrators can create their own application
  detectors to detect new applications. The detectors are written in Lua
  and interface with Snort using a well-defined C-Lua API.

* Open Detector Package (ODP): A set of pre-defined application detectors are
  provided by the Snort team and can be downloaded from snort.org.

==== Dependency Requirements

For proper functioning of the AppId inspector, at a minimum stream flow
tracking must be enabled. In addition, to identify TCP-based or UDP-based
applications then the appropriate stream inspector must be enabled, e.g.
stream_tcp or stream_udp.

In addition, in order to identify HTTP-based applications, the HTTP
inspector must be enabled. Otherwise, only non-HTTP applications will be
identified.

AppId subscribes to the inspection events published by other inspectors,
such as the HTTP and SSL inspectors, to gain access to the data needed. It
uses that data to help determine the application ID.

==== Configuration

The AppId feature can be enabled via configuration. To enable it with the
default settings use:

    appid = { }

To use an AppId as a matching parameter in an IPS rule, use the 'appids'
keyword.  For example, to block HTTP traffic that contains a specific header:

    block tcp any any -> 192.168.0.1 any ( msg:"Block Malicious HTTP header";
      appids:"HTTP"; content:"X-Header: malicious"; sid:18000; )

Alternatively, the HTTP application can be specified in place of 'tcp' instead
of using the 'appids' keyword. The AppId inspector will set the service when
it is discovered so it can be used in IPS rules like this. Note that this rule
also does not specify the IPs or ports which default to 'any'.

    block http ( msg:"Block Malicious HTTP header";
      content:"X-Header: malicious"; sid:18000; )

It's possible to specify multiple applications (as many as desired) with
the appids keyword. A rule is considered a match if any of the applications
on the rule match. Note that this rule does not match specific content which
will reduce performance.

    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.0.1 any ( msg:"Alert ";
      appids:"telnet,ssh,smtp,http";

Below is a minimal Snort configuration that is sufficient to block flows
based on a specific HTTP header:

    require("snort_config")

    dir = os.getenv('SNORT_LUA_PATH')

    if ( not dir ) then
        dir = '.'
    end

    dofile(dir .. '/snort_defaults.lua')


    local_rules =
    [[
    block http ( msg:"openAppId: test content match for app http";
    content:"X-Header: malicious"; sid:18760; rev:4; )
    ]]

    stream = { }

    stream_tcp = { }

    binder =
    {
        {
            when =
            {
                proto = 'tcp',
                ports = [[ 80 8080 ]],
            },
            use =
            {
                type = 'http_inspect',
            },
        },
    }

    http_inspect = { }

    appid = { }

    ips =
    {
        rules = local_rules,
    }

==== Session Application Identifiers

There are up to four AppIds stored in a session as defined below:

* serviceAppId - An appId associated with server side of a session. Example:
  http server.

* clientAppId - An appId associated with application on client side of a
  session.  Example: Firefox.

* payloadAppId - For services like http this appId is associated with a
  webserver host.  Example: Facebook.

* miscAppId - For some encapsulated protocols, this is the highest
  encapsulated application.

For packets originating from the client, a payloadAppid in a session is
matched with all AppIds listed on a rule. Thereafter miscAppId, clientAppId
and serviceAppId are matched. Since Alert Events contain one AppId, only the
first match is reported. If a rule without an appids option matches, then the
most specific appId (in order of payload, misc, client, server) is reported.

The same logic is followed for packets originating from the server with one
exception.  The order of matching is changed to make serviceAppId come
before clientAppId.

==== AppId Usage Statistics

The AppId inspector prints application network usage periodically in the snort
log directory in unified2 format. File name, time interval for statistic and
file rollover are controlled by appId inspection configuration.

==== Open Detector Package (ODP) Installation

Application detectors from Snort team will be delivered in a separate package
called the Open Detector Package (ODP) that can be downloaded from snort.org.
ODP is a package that contains the following artifacts:

* Application detectors in the Lua language.

* Port detectors, which are port only application detectors, in meta-data in
  YAML format.

* appMapping.data file containing application metadata. This file should not
  be modified.  The first column contains application identifier and second
  column contains application name.  Other columns contain internal
  information.

* Lua library files DetectorCommon.lua, flowTrackerModule.lua and
  hostServiceTrackerModule.lua

A user can install the ODP package in any directory and configure this
directory via the app_detector_dir option in the appid preprocessor
configuration.  Installing ODP will not modify any subdirectory named
custom, where user-created detectors are located.

When installed, ODP will create following sub-directories:

    * odp/port    //Cisco port-only detectors
    * odp/lua     //Cisco Lua detectors
    * odp/libs    //Cisco Lua modules

==== User Created Application Detectors

Users can detect new applications by adding detectors in the Lua language. A
document will be posted on the Snort Website with details on API. Users can also
copy over Snort team provided detectors and modify them. Users can also use the
detector creation tool described in the next section.

Users must organize their Lua detectors and libraries by creating the
following directory structure, under the ODP installation directory.

    * custom/port    //port-only detectors
    * custom/lua     //Lua detectors
    * custom/libs    //Lua modules

The root path is specified by the "app_detector_dir" parameter of the appid
section of snort.conf:

    appid  =
    {
        app_detector_dir = '/usr/local/lib/openappid',
    }

So the path to the user-created lua files would be
/usr/local/lib/openappid/custom/lua/

None of the directories below /usr/local/lib/openappid/ would be added for
you.

==== Application Detector Creation Tool

For rudimentary Lua detectors, there is a tool provided called
appid_detector_builder.sh.  This is a simple, menu-driven bash script
which creates .lua files in your current directory, based on your choices
and on patterns you supply.

When you launch the script, it will prompt for the Application Id
that you are giving for your detector. This is free-form ASCII with
minor restrictions. The Lua detector file will be named based on your
Application Id. If the file name already exists you will be prompted to
overwrite it.

You will also be prompted for a description of your detector to be placed
in the comments of the Lua source code. This is optional.

You will then be asked a series of questions designed to construct Lua
code based on the kind of pattern data, protocol, port(s), etc.

When complete, the Protocol menu will be changed to include the option,
"Save Detector".  Instead of saving the file and exiting the script,
you are allowed to give additional criteria for another pattern which
may also be incorporated in the detection scheme. Then either pattern,
when matched, will be considered a valid detection.

For example, your first choices might create an HTTP detection pattern
of "example.com", and the next set of choices would add the HTTP
detection pattern of "example.uk.co" (an equally fictional British
counterpart). They would then co-exist in the Lua detector, and either
would cause a detection with the name you give for your Application Id.

The resulting .lua file will need to be placed in the directory,
"custom/lua", described in the previous section of the README above called
"User Created Application Detectors"
