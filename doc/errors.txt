  where a table is required (e.g. xyz = 2 should be xyz = { }).

_ERROR can't find x.y_

* module x does not have a parameter named y.  check --help-module x for
  available parameters.

_ERROR invalid x.y = z_

* the value z is out of range for x.y.  check --help-config x.y for the range
  allowed.

_ERROR: x = { y = z } is in conf but is not being applied_

* make sure that x = { } isn't set later because it will override the
  earlier setting.  same for x.y.

_FATAL: can't load lua/errors.lua: lua/errors.lua:68: '=' expected near
';'_

* this is a syntax error reported by Lua to Snort on line 68 of errors.lua.

_ERROR: rules(2) unknown rule keyword: find._

* this was due to not including the --script-path.

_WARNING: unknown symbol x_

* if you any variables, you can squelch such warnings by setting them in
  an environment variable SNORT_IGNORE.  to ignore x, y, and z:

    export SNORT_IGNORE="x y z"
