The rule options byte_test and byte_jump were written to support
writing rules for protocols that have length encoded data. RPC was 
the protocol that spawned the requirement for these two rule options, 
as RPC uses simple length based encoding for passing data.

In order to understand why byte test and byte jump are useful, let's 
go through an exploit attempt against the sadmind service.

This is the payload of the exploit:

Let's break this up, describe each of the fields, and figure out how to write a
rule to catch this exploit.  

There are a few things to note with RPC:

Numbers are written as uint32s, taking four bytes.  The number 26 would
show up as 0x0000001a.

Strings are written as a uint32 specifying the length of the string, the
string, and then null bytes to pad the length of the string to end on a 4-byte
boundary.  The string 'bob' would show up as 0x00000003626f6200.

  89 09 9c e2     - the request id, a random uint32, unique to each request
  00 00 00 00     - rpc type (call = 0, response = 1)
  00 00 00 02     - rpc version (2)
  00 01 87 88     - rpc program (0x00018788 = 100232 = sadmind)
  00 00 00 0a     - rpc program version (0x0000000a = 10)
  00 00 00 01     - rpc procedure (0x00000001 = 1)
  00 00 00 01     - credential flavor (1 = auth_unix)
  00 00 00 20     - length of auth_unix data (0x20 = 32)

  ## the next 32 bytes are the auth_unix data
  40 28 3a 10 - unix timestamp (0x40283a10 = 1076378128 = feb 10 01:55:28 2004 gmt)
  00 00 00 0a - length of the client machine name (0x0a = 10)
  4d 45 54 41 53 50 4c 4f 49 54 00 00  - metasploit

  00 00 00 00 - uid of requesting user (0)
  00 00 00 00 - gid of requesting user (0)
  00 00 00 00 - extra group ids (0)

  00 00 00 00 - verifier flavor (0 = auth_null, aka none)
  00 00 00 00 - length of verifier (0, aka none)

The rest of the packet is the request that gets passed to procedure 1 of
sadmind.

However, we know the vulnerability is that sadmind trusts the uid coming from
the client.  sadmind runs any request where the client's uid is 0 as root.  As
such, we have decoded enough of the request to write our rule.  

First, we need to make sure that our packet is an RPC call.
    
    content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;

Then, we need to make sure that our packet is a call to sadmind.
    
    content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;

Then, we need to make sure that our packet is a call to the procedure 1, the
vulnerable procedure.  
   
    content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 4;

Then, we need to make sure that our packet has auth_unix credentials.  
    
    content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 24, depth 4;

We don't care about the hostname, but we want to skip over it and check a
number value after the hostname.  This is where byte_test is useful.  Starting
at the length of the hostname, the data we have is:

  00 00 00 0a 4d 45 54 41 53 50 4c 4f 49 54 00 00
  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  00 00 00 00

We want to read 4 bytes, turn it into a number, and jump that many bytes
forward, making sure to account for the padding that RPC requires on strings.
If we do that, we are now at:

  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  00 00 00 00 

which happens to be the exact location of the uid, the value we want to check.

In English, we want to read 4 bytes, 36 bytes from the beginning of the packet,
and turn those 4 bytes into an integer and jump that many bytes forward,
aligning on the 4-byte boundary.  To do that in a Snort rule, we use:

    byte_jump:4,36,align;

then we want to look for the uid of 0.

    content:"|00 00 00 00|", within 4;

Now that we have all the detection capabilities for our rule, let's put them
all together.  

    content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;
    content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;
    content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 4;
    content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 24, depth 4;
    byte_jump:4,36,align;
    content:"|00 00 00 00|", within 4;

The 3rd and fourth string match are right next to each other, so we should
combine those patterns.  We end up with:

    content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;
    content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;
    content:"|00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 8;
    byte_jump:4,36,align;
    content:"|00 00 00 00|", within 4;

If the sadmind service was vulnerable to a buffer overflow when reading the
client's hostname, instead of reading the length of the hostname and jumping
that many bytes forward, we would check the length of the hostname to make sure
it is not too large.  

To do that, we would read 4 bytes, starting 36 bytes into the packet, turn it
into a number, and then make sure it is not too large (let's say bigger than
200 bytes).  In Snort, we do: 

    byte_test:4,>,200,36;
    
Our full rule would be:    

    content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;
    content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;
    content:"|00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 8;
    byte_test:4,>,200,36;
