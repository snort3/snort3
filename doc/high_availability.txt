HighAvailability (or HA) is a Snort module that provides state coherency
between two partner snort instances.  It uses SideChannel for messaging.

There can be multiple types of HA within Snort and Snort plugins.  HA
implements an extensible architecture to enable plugins to subscribe to the
base flow HA messaging.  These plugins can then include their own messages
along with the flow cache HA messages.

HA produces and consumes two type of messages:

* Update - Update flow status.  Plugins may add their own data to the messages

* Delete - A flow has been removed from the cache

The HA module is configured with these items:

    high_availability =
    {
        ports = "1",
        enable = true,
        min_age = 0.0,
        min_sync = 0.0
    }

The 'ports' item maps to the SideChannel port to use for the HA messaging.

The 'enabled' item controls the overall HA operation.

The items min_age and min_sync are used in the stream HA logic.  min_age is
the number of seconds that a flow must exist in the flow cache before sending
HA messages to the partner.  min_sync is the minimum time between HA status
updates.  HA messages for a particular flow will not be sent faster than
min_sync.  Both are expressed as a floating point number of seconds.

HA messages are composed of the base 'stream' information plus any content
from additional modules.  Modules subscribe HA in order to add message
content.  The 'stream' HA content is always present in the messages while
the ancillary module content is only present when requested via a status
change request.
