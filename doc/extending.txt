=== Plugins

Plugins have an associated API defined for each type, all of which share a
common 'header', called the BaseApi.  A dynamic library makes its plugins
available by exporting the snort_plugins symbol, which is a null terminated
array of BaseApi pointers.

The BaseApi includes type, name, API version, plugin version, and function
pointers for constructing and destructing a Module.  The specific API add
various other data and functions for their given roles.


=== Modules

If we are defining a new Inspector called, say, gadget, it might be
configured in snort.lua like this:

    gadget =
    {
        brain = true,
        claw = 3
    }

When the gadget table is processed, Snort will look for a module called
gadget.  If that Module has an associated API, it will be used to configure
a new instance of the plugin.  In this case, a GadgetModule would be
instantiated, brain and claw would be set, and the Module instance would be
passed to the GadgetInspector constructor.

Module has three key virtual methods:

* *begin()* - called when Snort starts processing the associated Lua
  table.  This is a good place to allocate any required data and set
  defaults.
* *set()* - called to set each parameter after validation.
* *end()* - called when Snort finishes processing the associated Lua
  table.  This is where additional integrity checks of related parameters
  should be done.

The configured Module is passed to the plugin constructor which pulls the
configuration data from the Module.  For non-trivial configurations, the
working paradigm is that Module hands a pointer to the configured data to
the plugin instance which takes ownership.

Note that there is at most one instance of a given Module, even if multiple
plugin instances are created which use that Module.  (Multiple instances
require Snort binding configuration.)


=== Inspectors

There are several types of inspector, which determines which inspectors are
executed when:

* IT_BINDER - determines which inspectors apply to given flows

* IT_WIZARD - determines which service inspector to use if none explicitly
  bound

* IT_PACKET - used to process all packets before session and service processing
  (e.g. normalize)

* IT_NETWORK - processes packets w/o service (e.g. arp_spoof, back_orifice)

* IT_STREAM - for flow tracking, ip defrag, and tcp reassembly

* IT_SERVICE - for http, ftp, telnet, etc.

* IT_PROBE - process all packets after all the above (e.g. perf_monitor,
  port_scan)


=== Codecs

The Snort Codecs decipher raw packets. These Codecs are now completely
pluggable; almost every Snort Codec can be built dynamically and replaced
with an alternative, customized Codec. The pluggable nature has also made
it easier to build new Codecs for protocols without having to touch the
Snort code base. 

The first step in creating a Codec is defining its class and protocol.
Every Codec must inherit from the Snort Codec class defined in
"framework/codec.h". The following is an example Codec named "example" and
has an associated struct that is 14 bytes long.

    #include <cstdint>
    #include <arpa/inet.h>
    #include “framework/codec.h”
    #include "main/snort_types.h"

    #define EX_NAME “example”
    #define EX_HELP “example codec help string”

    struct Example
    {
        uint8_t dst[6];
        uint8_t src[6];
        uint16_t ethertype;

        static inline uint8_t size()
        { return 14; }
    }

    class ExCodec : public Codec
    {
    public:
        ExCodec() : Codec(EX_NAME) { }
        ~ExCodec() { }

        bool decode(const RawData&, CodecData&, DecodeData&) override;
        void get_protocol_ids(std::vector<uint16_t>&) override;
    };

After defining ExCodec, the next step is adding the Codec's decode
functionality. The function below does this by implementing a valid decode
function. The first parameter, which is the RawData struct, provides both a
pointer to the raw data that has come from a wire and the length of that raw
data. The function takes this information and validates that there are enough
bytes for this protocol. If the raw data's length is less than 14 bytes, the
function returns false and Snort discards the packet; the packet is neither
inspected nor processed. If the length is greater than 14 bytes, the function
populates two fields in the CodecData struct, next_prot_id and lyr_len. The
lyr_len field tells Snort the number of bytes that this layer contains. The
next_prot_id field provides Snort the value of the next EtherType or IP
protocol number.

    bool ExCodec::decode(const RawData& raw, CodecData& codec, DecodeData&)
    {
       if ( raw.len < Example::size() )
           return false;

        const Example* const ex = reinterpret_cast<const Example*>(raw.data);
        codec.next_prot_id = ntohs(ex->ethertype);
        codec.lyr_len = ex->size();
        return true;
    }

For instance, assume this decode function receives the following raw data with
a validated length of 32 bytes:

    00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77    88 99 aa bb 08 00 45 00
    00 38 00 01 00 00 40 06    5c ac 0a 01 02 03 0a 09

The Example struct's EtherType field is the 13 and 14 bytes. Therefore, this
function tells Snort that the next protocol has an EtherType of 0x0800.
Additionally, since the lyr_len is set to 14, Snort knows that the next
protocol begins 14 bytes after the beginning of this protocol. The Codec with
EtherType 0x0800, which happens to be the IPv4 Codec, will receive the
following data with a validated length of 18 ( == 32 – 14):

    45 00 00 38 00 01 00 00    40 06 5c ac 0a 01 02 03
    0a 09

How does Snort know that the IPv4 Codec has an EtherType of 0x0800? The
Codec class has a second virtual function named get_protocol_ids(). When
implementing the function, a Codec can register for any number of values
between 0x0000 - 0xFFFF. Then, if the next_proto_id is set to a value for which
this Codec has registered, this Codec's decode function will be called. As a
general note, the protocol ids between [0, 0x00FF] are IP protocol numbers,
[0x0100, 0x05FF] are custom types, and [0x0600, 0xFFFF] are EtherTypes.

For example, in the get_protocol_ids function below, the ExCodec registers for
the protocols numbers 17, 787, and 2054. 17 happens to be the protocol number
for UDP while 2054 is ARP's EtherType. Therefore, this Codec will now attempt
to decode UDP and ARP data. Additionally, if any Codec sets the
next_protocol_id to 787, ExCodec's decode function will be called. Some custom
protocols are already defined in the file "protocols/protocol_ids.h" 

    void ExCodec::get_protocol_ids(std::vector<uint16_t>&v)
    {
        v.push_back(0x0011); // == 17  == UDP
        v.push_back(0x1313); // == 787  == custom
        v.push_back(0x0806); // == 2054  == ARP
    }

To register a Codec for Data Link Type's rather than protocols, the function
get_data_link_type() can be similarly implemented.

The final step to creating a pluggable Codec is the snort_plugins array. This
array is important because when Snort loads a dynamic library, the program
only find plugins that are inside the snort_plugins array. In other words, if a
plugin has not been added to the snort_plugins array, that plugin will not be
loaded into Snort.

Although the details will not be covered in this post, the following code
snippet is a basic CodecApi that Snort can load. This snippet can be copied
and used with only three minor changes. First, in the function ctor, ExCodec
should be replaced with the name of the Codec that is being built. Second,
EX_NAME must match the Codec's name or Snort will be unable to load this Codec.
Third, EX_HELP should be replaced with the general description of this Codec.
Once this code snippet has been added, ExCodec is ready to be compiled and
plugged into Snort.

    static Codec* ctor(Module*)
    { return new ExCodec; }

    static void dtor(Codec *cd)
    { delete cd; }

    static const CodecApi ex_api =
    {
        {
            PT_CODEC,
            EX_NAME,
            EX_HELP,
            CDAPI_PLUGIN_V0,
            0,
            nullptr,
            nullptr,
        },
        nullptr, // pointer to a function called during Snort's startup.
        nullptr, // pointer to a function called during Snort's exit.
        nullptr, // pointer to a function called during thread's startup.
        nullptr, // pointer to a function called during thread's destruction.
        ctor, // pointer to the codec constructor.
        dtor, // pointer to the codec destructor.
    };

    SO_PUBLIC const BaseApi* snort_plugins[] =
    {
        &ex_api.base,
        nullptr
    };

Two example Codecs are available in the extra directory on git and the extra
tarball on the Snort page. One of those examples is the Token Ring Codec
while the other example is the PIM Codec.

As a final note, there are four more virtual functions that a Codec should
implement: encode, format, update, and log. If the functions are not
implemented Snort will not throw any errors. However, Snort may also be unable
to accomplish some of its basic functionality.

* encode is called whenever Snort actively responds and needs to builds a
  packet, i.e. whenever a rule using an IPS ACTION like react, reject, or rewrite
  is triggered. This function is used to build the response packet protocol by
  protocol.

* format is called when Snort is rebuilding a packet. For instance, every time
  Snort reassembles a TCP stream or IP fragment, format is called. Generally,
  this function either swaps any source and destination fields in the protocol or
  does nothing.

* update is similar to format in that it is called when Snort is reassembling a
  packet. Unlike format, this function only sets length fields.

* log is called when either the log_codecs logger or a custom logger that calls
  PacketManager::log_protocols is used when running Snort.


=== IPS Actions

Action plugins specify a builtin action in the API which is used to
determine verdict.  (Conversely, builtin actions don't have an associated
plugin function.)

=== Developers Guide

Run doc/dev_guide.sh to generate /tmp/dev_guide.html, an annotated guide to
the source tree.

=== Piglet Test Harness

In order to assist with plugin development, an experimental mode called "piglet" mode
is provided. With piglet mode, you can call individual methods for a specific plugin.
The piglet tests are specified as Lua scripts. Each piglet test script defines a test
for a specific plugin.

Here is a minimal example of a piglet test script for the IPv4 Codec plugin:

    plugin =
    {
        type = "piglet",
        name = "codec::ipv4",
        use_defaults = true,
        test = function()
            local daq_header = DAQHeader.new()
            local raw_buffer = RawBuffer.new("some data")
            local codec_data = CodecData.new()
            local decode_data = DecodeData.new()

            return Codec.decode(
                daq_header,
                raw_buffer,
                codec_data,
                decode_data
            )
        end
    }

To run snort in piglet mode, first build snort with the ENABLE_PIGLET option turned on
(pass the flag -DENABLE_PIGLET:BOOL=ON in cmake).

Then, run the following command:

    snort --script-path $test_scripts --piglet

(where $test_scripts is the directory containing your piglet tests).

The test runner will generate a check-like output, indicating the
the results of each test script.

=== Piglet Lua API

This section documents the API that piglet exposes to Lua.
Refer to the piglet directory in the source tree for examples of usage.

Note: Because of the differences between the Lua and C\++ data model and type
system, not all parameters map directly to the parameters of the underlying
C\++ member functions. Every effort has been made to keep the mappings consist,
but there are still some differences. They are documented below.

==== Plugin Instances

For each test, piglet instantiates plugin specified in the ++name++ field of the
++plugin++ table. The virtual methods of the instance are exposed in a table
unique to each plugin type. The name of the table is the CamelCase name of the
plugin type.

For example, codec plugins have a virtual method called ++decode++. This method
is called like this:

    Codec.decode(...)

*Codec*

* ++Codec.get_data_link_type() -> { int, int, ... }++
* ++Codec.get_protocol_ids() -> { int, int, ... }++
* ++Codec.decode(DAQHeader, RawBuffer, CodecData, DecodeData) -> bool++
* ++Codec.log(RawBuffer, uint[lyr_len])++
* ++Codec.encode(RawBuffer, EncState, Buffer) -> bool++
* ++Codec.update(uint[flags_hi], uint[flags_lo], RawBuffer, uint[lyr_len] -> int++
* ++Codec.format(bool[reverse], RawBuffer, DecodeData)++

Differences:

* In ++Codec.update()++, the ++(uint64_t) flags++ parameter has been split into
++flags_hi++ and ++flags_lo++

*Inspector*

* ++Inspector.configure()++
* ++Inspector.tinit()++
* ++Inspector.tterm()++
* ++Inspector.likes(Packet)++
* ++Inspector.eval(Packet)++
* ++Inspector.clear(Packet)++
* ++Inspector.get_buf_from_key(string[key], Packet, RawBuffer) -> bool++
* ++Inspector.get_buf_from_id(uint[id], Packet, RawBuffer) -> bool++
* ++Inspector.get_buf_from_type(uint[type], Packet, RawBuffer) -> bool++
* ++Inspector.get_splitter(bool[to_server]) -> StreamSplitter++

Differences:
* In ++Inspector.configure()++, the ++SnortConfig*++ parameter is passed implicitly.
* the overloaded ++get_buf()++ member function has been split into three separate methods.

*IpsOption*

* ++IpsOption.hash() -> int++
* ++IpsOption.is_relative() -> bool++
* ++IpsOption.fp_research() -> bool++
* ++IpsOption.get_cursor_type() -> int++
* ++IpsOption.eval(Cursor, Packet) -> int++
* ++IpsOption.action(Packet)++

*IpsAction*

* ++IpsAction.exec(Packet)++

*Logger*

* ++Logger.open()++
* ++Logger.close()++
* ++Logger.reset()++
* ++Logger.alert(Packet, string[message], Event)++
* ++Logger.log(Packet, string[message], Event)++

*SearchEngine*

Currently, SearchEngine does not expose any methods.

*SoRule*

Currently, SoRule does not expose any methods.

===== Interface Objects

Many of the plugins take C\++ classes and structs as arguments. These objects
are exposed to the Lua API as Lua userdata. Exposed objects are instantiated
by calling the ++new++ method from each object's method table.

For example, the DecodeData object can be instantiated and exposed to Lua
like this:

    local decode_data = DecodeData.new(...)

Each object also exposes useful methods for getting and setting member variables,
and calling the C\++ methods contained in the the object. These methods can
be accessed using the ++:++ accessor syntax:

    decode_data:set({ sp = 80, dp = 3500 })

Since this is just syntactic sugar for passing the object as the first parameter
of the function ++DecodeData.set++, an equivalent form is:

    decode_data.set(decode_data, { sp = 80, dp = 3500 })

or even:

    DecodeData.set(decode_data, { sp = 80, dp = 3500 })

*Buffer*
