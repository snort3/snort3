The remainder of this section provides a high level survey of the inputs,
processing, and outputs available with Snort 3.0.

Snort++ is the project that is creating Snort 3.0.  In this manual "Snort"
or "Snort 3" refers to the 3.0 version and earlier versions will be
referred to as "Snort 2" where the distinction is relevant.


=== First Steps

Snort can be configured to perform complex packet processing and deep
packet inspection but it is best start simply and work up to more
interesting tasks.  Snort won't do anything you didn't specifically ask it
to do so it is safe to just try things out and see what happens.  Let's
start by just running Snort with no arguments:

    $ snort

That will output usage information including some basic help commands.  You
should run all of these commands now to see what is available:

    $ snort -V
    $ snort -?
    $ snort --help

Note that Snort has extensive command line help available so if anything
below isn't clear, there is probably a way to get the exact information you
need from the command line.

Now let's examine the packets in a capture file (pcap):

    $ snort -r a.pcap

Snort will decode and count the packets in the file and output some
statistics.  Note that the output excludes non-zero numbers so it is easy
to see what is there.

You may have noticed that there are command line options to limit the
number of packets examined or set a filter to select particular packets.
Now is a good time to experiment with those options.

If you want to see details on each packet, you can dump the packets to
console like this:

    $ snort -r a.pcap -L dump

Add the -d option to see the TCP and UDP payload.  Now let's switch to live
traffic.  Replace eth0 in the below command with an available network
interface:

    $ snort -i eth0 -L dump

Unless the interface is taken down, Snort will just keep running, so enter
Control-C to terminate or use the -n option to limit the number of packets.

Generally it is better to capture the packets for later analysis like this:

    $ snort -i eth0 -L pcap -n 10

Snort will write 10 packets to log.pcap.# where # is a timestamp value.
You can read these back with -r and dump to console or pcap with -L.  You
get the idea.

Note that you can do similar things with other tools like tcpdump or
Wireshark however these commands are very useful when you want to check
your Snort setup.  

The examples above use the default pcap DAQ.  Snort supports non-pcap
interfaces as well via the DAQ (data acquisition) library.  Other DAQs
provide additional functionality such as inline operation and/or higher
performance.  There are even DAQs that support raw file processing (ie
without packets), socket processing, and plain text packets.  To load
external DAQ libraries and see available DAQs or select a particular DAQ
use one of these commands:

    $ snort --daq-dir <path> --daq-list
    $ snort --daq-dir <path> --daq <type>

Be sure to put the --daq-dir option ahead of the --daq-list option or the
external DAQs won't appear in the list.

To leverage intrusion detection features of Snort you will need to provide
some configuration details.  The next section breaks down what must be
done.


=== Configuration

Effective configuration of Snort is done via the environment, command
line, a Lua configuration file, and a set of rules.

Note that backwards compatibility with Snort 2 was sacrificed to obtain
new and improved functionality.  While Snort 3 leverages some of the
Snort 2 code base, a lot has changed.  The configuration of Snort 3 is
done with Lua, so your old conf won't work as is.  Rules are still text
based but with syntax tweaks, so your 2.X rules must be fixed up.  However,
snort2lua will help you convert your conf and rules to the new format.

==== Environment

LUA_PATH must be set based on your install:

    LUA_PATH=$install_prefix/include/snort/lua/\?.lua\;\;

SNORT_LUA_PATH must be set to load auxiliary configuration files if you use
the default snort.lua.  For example:

    export SNORT_LUA_PATH=$install_prefix/etc/snort

==== Command Line

A simple command line might look like this:

    snort -c snort.lua -R cool.rules -r some.pcap -A cmg

To understand what that does, you can start by just running snort with no
arguments by running snort --help.  Help for all configuration and rule
options is available via a suitable command line.  In this case:

-c snort.lua is the main configuration file.  This is a Lua script that is
executed when loaded.

-R cool.rules contains some detection rules.  You can write your own or
obtain them from Talos (native 3.0 rules are not yet available from Talos
so you must convert them with snort2lua).  You can also put your rules
directly in your configuration file.

-r some.pcap tells Snort to read network traffic from the given packet
capture file.  You could instead use -i eth0 to read from a live interface.
There many other options available too depending on the DAQ you use.

-A cmg says to output intrusion events in "cmg" format, which has basic
header details followed by the payload in hex and text.

Note that you add to and/or override anything in your configuration file by
using the --lua command line option.  For example:

    --lua 'ips = { enable_builtin_rules = true }'

will load the built-in decoder and inspector rules.  In this case, ips is
overwritten with the config you see above.  If you just want to change the
config given in your configuration file you would do it like this:

    --lua 'ips.enable_builtin_rules = true'

==== Configuration File

The configuration file gives you complete control over how Snort processes
packets.  Start with the default snort.lua included in the distribution
because that contains some key ingredients.  Note that most of the
configurations look like:

    stream = { }

This means enable the stream module using internal defaults.  To see what
those are, you could run:

    snort --help-config stream

Snort is organized into a collection of builtin and plugin modules.
If a module has parameters, it is configured by a Lua table of the same
name.  For example, we can see what the active module has to offer with
this command:

    $ snort --help-module active

    What: configure responses

    Type: basic

    Configuration:

    int active.attempts = 0: number of TCP packets sent per response (with
    varying sequence numbers) { 0:20 }

    string active.device: use 'ip' for network layer responses or 'eth0' etc
    for link layer

    string active.dst_mac: use format '01:23:45:67:89:ab'

    int active.max_responses = 0: maximum number of responses { 0: }

    int active.min_interval = 255: minimum number of seconds between
    responses { 1: }

This says active is a basic module that has several parameters.  For each,
you will see:

    type module.name = default: help { range }

For example, the active module has a max_responses parameter that takes
non-negative integer values and defaults to zero.  We can change that in
Lua as follows:

    active = { max_responses = 1 }

or:

    active = { }
    active.max_responses = 1

If we also wanted to limit retries to at least 5 seconds, we could do:

    active = { max_responses = 1, min_interval = 5 }

==== Rules

Rules determine what Snort is looking for.  They can be put directly in
your Lua configuration file with the ips module, on the command line with
--lua, or in external files.  Generally you will have many rules obtained
from various sources such as Talos and loading external files is the way to
go so we will summarize that here.  Add this to your Lua configuration:

    ips = { include = 'rules.txt' }

to load the external rules file named rules.txt.  You can only specify
one file this way but rules files can include other rules files with the
include statement.  In addition you can load rules like:

    $ sort -c snort.lua -R rules.txt

You can use both approaches together.

==== Converting Your 2.X Configuration

If you have a working 2.X configuration snort2lua makes it easy to get up
and running with Snort 3.  This tool will convert your configuration and/or
rules files automatically.  You will want to clean up the results and
double check that it is doing exactly what you need.

    snort2lua -c snort.conf

The above command will generate snort.lua based on your 2.X configuration.
For more information and options for more sophisticated use cases, see the
Snort2Lua section later in the manual.

=== Output

Snort can produce quite a lot of data.  In the following we will summarize
the key aspects of the core output types.  Additional data such as from
appid is covered later.

==== Basic Statistics

At shutdown, Snort will output various counts depending on configuration
and the traffic processed.  Generally, you may see:

* Packet Statistics - this includes data from the DAQ and decoders such as
  the number of packets received and number of UDP packets.

* Module Statistics - each module tracks activity via a set of peg counts
  that indicate how many times something was observed or performed.  This
  might include the number of HTTP GET requests processed and the number of
  TCP reset packets trimmed.

* File Statistics - look here for a breakdown of file type, bytes,
  signatures.

* Summary Statistics - this includes total runtime for packet processing
  and the packets per second.  Profiling data will appear here as well if
  configured.

Note that only the non-zero counts are output.  Run this to see the
available counts:

    $ snort --help-counts

==== Alerts

If you configured rules, you will need to configure alerts to see the
details of detection events.  Use the -A option like this:

    $ snort -c snort.lua -r a.pcap -A cmg

There are many types of alert outputs possible.  Here is a brief list:

* -A cmg is the same as -A fast -d -e and will show information about the
  alert along with packet headers and payload.

* -A u2 is the same as -A unified2 and will log events and triggering
  packets in a binary file that you can feed to other tools for post
  processing.  Note that Snort 3 does not provide the raw packets for
  alerts on PDUs; you will get the actual buffer that alerted.

* -A csv will output various fields in comma separated value format.  This
  is entirely customizable and very useful for pcap analysis.

To see the available alert types, you can run this command:

    $ snort --list-plugins | grep logger

==== Files and Paths

Note that output is specific to each packet thread.  If you run 4 packet
threads with u2 output, you will get 4 different u2 files.  The basic
structure is:

    <logdir>/[<run_prefix>][<id#>][<X>]<name>

where:

* logdir is set with -l and defaults to ./

* run_prefix is set with --run-prefix else not used

* id# is the packet thread number that writes the file; with one packet
  thread, id# (zero) is omitted without --id-zero

* X is / if you use --id-subdir, else _ if id# is used

* name is based on module name that writes the file

Additional considerations:

* There is no way to explicitly configure a full path to avoid issues with
  multiple packet threads.
  
* All text mode outputs default to stdout

==== Performance Statistics

Still more data is available beyond the above.

* By configuring the perf_monitor module you can capture a configurable set
  of peg counts during runtime.  This is useful to feed to an external
  program so you can see what is happening without stopping Snort.

* The profiler module allows you to track time and space used by module and
  rules.  Use this data to tune your system for best performance.  The
  output will show up under Summary Statistics at shutdown.
