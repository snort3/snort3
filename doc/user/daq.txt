The Data AcQuisition library (DAQ), provides pluggable packet I/O.  LibDAQ
replaces direct calls to libraries like libpcap with an abstraction layer
that facilitates operation on a variety of hardware and software interfaces
without requiring changes to Snort.  It is possible to select the DAQ module
and mode when invoking Snort to perform pcap readback or inline operation,
etc.  The DAQ library may be useful for other packet processing
applications and the modular nature allows you to build new modules for
other platforms.

The DAQ library exists as a separate repository on the official Snort 3 GitHub
project (https://github.com/snort3/libdaq) and contains a number of bundled DAQ
modules including AFPacket, Divert, NFQ, PCAP, and Netmap implementations.
Snort 3 itself contains a few new DAQ modules mostly used for testing as
described below.  Additionally, DAQ modules developed by third parties to
facilitate the usage of their own hardware and software platforms exist.


=== Building the DAQ Library and Its Bundled DAQ Modules

Refer to the READMEs in the LibDAQ source tarball for instructions on how to
build the library and modules as well as details on configuring and using the
bundled DAQ modules.


=== Configuration

As with a number of features in Snort 3, the LibDAQ and DAQ module
configuration may be controlled using either the command line options or by
configuring the 'daq' Snort module in the Lua configuration (command line
option has higher precedence).

DAQ modules may be statically built into Snort, but the more common case is to
use DAQ modules that have been built as dynamically loadable objects.  Because
of this, the first thing to take care of is informing Snort of any locations it
should search for dynamic DAQ modules.  From the command line, this can be done
with one or more invocations of the --daq-dir option, which takes a
colon-separated set of paths to search as its argument.  All arguments will be
collected into a list of locations to be searched. In the Lua configuration, the
'daq.module_dirs[]' property is a list of paths for the same purpose.

Next, one must select which DAQ modules they wish to use by name.  At least one
base module and zero or more wrapper modules may be selected.  This is done
using the --daq options from the command line or the 'daq.modules[]' list-type
property.  To get a list of the available modules, run Snort with the --daq-list
option making sure to specify any DAQ module search directories beforehand.  If
no DAQ module is specified, Snort will default to attempting to find and use a
DAQ module named 'pcap'.

Some DAQ modules can be further directly configured using DAQ module variables.
All DAQ module variables come in the form of either just a key or a key and a
value separated by an equals sign.  For example, 'debug' or 'fanout_type=hash'.
The command line option for specifying these is --daq-var and the configuration
file equivalent is the 'daq.modules[].variables[]' property.  The available
variables for each module will be shown when listing the available DAQ modules
with --daq-list.

The LibDAQ concept of operational mode (passive, inline, or file readback) is
automatically configured based on inferring the mode from other Snort
configuration.  The presence of -r or --pcap-* options implies 'read-file', -i
without -Q implies 'passive', and -i with -Q implies 'inline'.  The mode can be
overridden on a per-DAQ module basis with the --daq-mode option on the command
line or the 'daq.modules[].mode' property.

The DAQ module receive timeout is always configured to 1 second.  The packet
capture length (snaplen) defaults to 1518 bytes and can be overridden by the -s
command line option or 'daq.snaplen' property.

Finally, and most importantly, is the input specification for the DAQ module.
In readback mode, this is simply the file to be read back and analyzed.  For
live traffic processing, this is the name of the interface or other necessary
input specification as required by the DAQ module to understand what to operate
upon.  From the command line, the -r option is used to specify a file to be
read back and the -i option is used to indicate a live interface input
specification.  Both are covered by the 'daq.inputs[]' property.

For advanced use cases, one additional LibDAQ configuration exists: the number
of DAQ messages to request per receive call.  In Snort, this is referred to as
the DAQ "batch size" and defaults to 64.  The default can be overridden with
the --daq-batch-size command line option or 'daq.batch_size' property.  The
message pool size requested from the DAQ module will be four times this batch
size.


==== Command Line Example

    snort --daq-dir /usr/local/lib/daq --daq-dir /opt/lib/daq --daq afpacket
--daq-var debug --daq-var fanout_type=hash -i eth1:eth2 -Q


==== Configuration File Example

The following is the equivalent of the above command line DAQ configuration in
Lua form:

    daq =
    {
        module_dirs =
        {
            '/usr/local/lib/daq',
            '/opt/lib/daq'
        },
        modules =
        {
            {
                name = 'afpacket',
                mode = 'inline',
                variables =
                {
                    'debug',
                    'fanout_type=hash'
                }
            }
        },
        inputs =
        {
            'eth1:eth2',
        },
        snaplen = 1518
    }

The 'daq.snaplen' property was included for completeness and may be omitted if
the default value is acceptable.


==== DAQ Module Configuration Stacks

Like briefly mentioned above, a DAQ configuration consists of a base DAQ module
and zero or more wrapper DAQ modules.  DAQ wrapper modules provide additional
functionality layered on top of the base module in a decorator pattern.  For
example, the Dump DAQ module will capture all passed or injected packets and
save them to a PCAP savefile.  This can be layered on top of something like the
PCAP DAQ module to assess which packets are making it through Snort without
being dropped and what actions Snort has taken that involved sending new or
modified packets out onto the network (e.g., TCP reset packets and TCP
normalizations).

To configure a DAQ module stack from the command line, the --daq option must
be given multiple times with the base module specified first followed by the
wrapper modules in the desired order (building up the stack).  Each --daq
option changes which module is being configured by subsequent --daq-var and
--daq mode options.

When configuring the same sort of stack in Lua, everything lives in the
'daq.modules[]' property.  'daq.modules[]' is an array of module configurations
pushed onto the stack from top to bottom.  Each module configuration *must*
contain the name of the DAQ module.  Additionally, it may contain an array of
variables ('daq.modules[].variables[]') and/or an operational mode
('daq.modules[].mode').

If only wrapper modules were specified, Snort will default to implicitly
configuring a base module with the name 'pcap' in 'read-file' mode.  This is a
convenience to mimic the previous behavior when selecting something like the
old Dump DAQ module that may be removed in the future.

For any particularly complicated setup, it is recommended that one configure
via a Lua configuration file rather than using the command line options.


=== Interaction With Multiple Packet Threads

All packet threads will receive the same DAQ instance configuration with the
potential exception of the input specification.

If Snort is in file readback mode, a full set of files will be constructed from
the -r/--pcap-file/--pcap-list/--pcap-dir/--pcap-filter options.  A number of
packet threads will be started up to the configured maximum (-z) to process
these files one at a time.  As a packet thread completes processing of a file,
it will be stopped and then started again with a different file input to
process.  If the number of packet threads configured exceeds the number of
files to process, or as the number of remaining input files dwindles below that
number, Snort will stop spawning new packet threads when it runs out of
unhandled input files.

When Snort is operating on live interfaces (-i), all packet threads up to the
configured maximum will always be started.  By default, if only one input
specification is given, all packet threads will receive the same input in their
configuration.  If multiple inputs are given, each thread will be given the
matching input (ordinally), falling back to the first if the number of packet
threads exceeds the number of inputs.


=== DAQ Modules Included With Snort 3

==== Socket Module

The socket module provides provides a stream socket server that will accept
up to 2 simultaneous connections and bridge them together while also
passing data to Snort for inspection.  The first connection accepted is
considered the client and the second connection accepted is considered the
server.  If there is only one connection, stream data can't be forwarded
but it is still inspected.

Each read from a socket of up to snaplen bytes is passed as a packet to
Snort along with the ability to retrieve a DAQ_UsrHdr_t structure via ioctl.
DAQ_UsrHdr_t conveys IP4 address, ports, protocol, and direction.  Socket
packets can be configured to be TCP or UDP.  The socket DAQ can be operated
in inline mode and is able to block packets.

Packets from the socket DAQ module are handled by Snort's stream_user module,
which must be configured in the Snort configuration.

To use the socket DAQ, start Snort like this:

    ./snort --daq-dir /path/to/lib/snort_extra/daq \
        --daq socket [--daq-var port=<port>] [--daq-var proto=<proto>] [-Q]

    <port> ::= 1..65535; default is 8000
    <proto> ::= tcp | udp

* This module only supports ip4 traffic.

* This module is only supported by Snort 3.  It is not compatible with
  Snort 2.

* This module is primarily for development and test.


==== File Module

The file module provides the ability to process files directly without having
to extract them from pcaps.  Use the file module with Snort's stream_file to
get file type identification and signature services.  The usual IPS detection
and logging, etc. is also available.

You can process all the files in a directory recursively using 8 threads
with these Snort options:

    --pcap-dir path -z 8

* This module is only supported by Snort 3.  It is not compatible with
  Snort 2.

* This module is primarily for development and test.


==== Hext Module

The hext module generates packets suitable for processing by Snort from
hex/plain text.  Raw packets include full headers and are processed
normally.  Otherwise the packets contain only payload and are accompanied
with flow information (4-tuple) suitable for processing by stream_user.

The first character of the line determines it's purpose:

    '$' command
    '#' comment
    '"' quoted string packet data
    'x' hex packet data
    ' ' empty line separates packets

The available commands are:

    $client <ip4> <port>
    $server <ip4> <port>

    $packet -> client
    $packet -> server

    $packet <addr> <port> -> <addr> <port>

    $sof <i32:ingressZone> <i32:egressZone> <i32:ingressIntf> <i32:egressIntf> <s:srcIp> <i16:srcPort> <s:destIp> <i16:dstPort> <u32:opaque> <u64:initiatorPkts> <u64:responderPkts> <u64:initiatorPktsDropped> <u64:responderPktsDropped> <u64:initiatorBytesDropped> <u64:responderBytesDropped> <u8:isQosAppliedOnSrcIntf> <timeval:sof_timestamp> <timeval:eof_timestamp> <u16:vlan> <u16:address_space_id> <u8:protocol>
    $eof <i32:ingressZone> <i32:egressZone> <i32:ingressIntf> <i32:egressIntf> <s:srcIp> <i16:srcPort> <s:destIp> <i16:dstPort> <u32:opaque> <u64:initiatorPkts> <u64:responderPkts> <u64:initiatorPktsDropped> <u64:responderPktsDropped> <u64:initiatorBytesDropped> <u64:responderBytesDropped> <u8:isQosAppliedOnSrcIntf> <timeval:sof_timestamp> <timeval:eof_timestamp> <u16:vlan> <u16:address_space_id> <u8:protocol>

Client and server are determined as follows.  $packet -> client indicates
to the client (from server) and $packet -> server indicates a packet to the
server (from client).  $packet followed by a 4-tuple uses the heuristic
that the client is the side with the greater port number.

The default client and server are 192.168.1.1 12345 and 10.1.2.3 80
respectively.  $packet commands with a 4-tuple do not change client and
server set with the other $packet commands.

$packet commands should be followed by packet data, which may contain any
combination of hex and strings.  Data for a packet ends with the next
command or a blank line.  Data after a blank line will start another packet
with the same tuple as the prior one.

$sof and $eof commands generate Start of Flow and End of Flow metapackets
respectively. They are followed by a definition of a DAQ_FlowStats_t data
structure which will be fed into Snort via the metadata callback.

Strings may contain the following escape sequences:

    \r = 0x0D = carriage return
    \n = 0x0A = new line
    \t = 0x09 = tab
    \\ = 0x5C = \

Format your input carefully; there is minimal error checking and little
tolerance for arbitrary whitespace.  You can use Snort's -L hext option to
generate hext input from a pcap.

* This module only supports ip4 traffic.

* This module is only supported by Snort 3.  It is not compatible with
  Snort 2.

* This module is primarily for development and test.

The hext DAQ also supports a raw mode which is activated by setting the
data link type.  For example, you can input full ethernet packets with
--daq-var dlt=1 (Data link types are defined in the DAQ include
sfbpf_dlt.h.)  Combine that with the hext logger in raw mode for a quick
(and dirty) way to edit pcaps.  With --lua "log_hext = { raw = true }", the
hext logger will dump the full packet in a way that can be read by the hext
DAQ in raw mode.  Here is an example:

    # 3 [96]

    x02 09 08 07 06 05 02 01 02 03 04 05 08 00 45 00 00 52 00 03  # ..............E..R..
    x00 00 40 06 5C 90 0A 01 02 03 0A 09 08 07 BD EC 00 50 00 00  # ..@.\............P..
    x00 02 00 00 00 02 50 10 20 00 8A E1 00 00 47 45 54 20 2F 74  # ......P.  .....GET /t
    x72 69 67 67 65 72 2F 31 20 48 54 54 50 2F 31 2E 31 0D 0A 48  # rigger/1 HTTP/1.1..H
    x6F 73 74 3A 20 6C 6F 63 61 6C 68 6F 73 74 0D 0A              # ost: localhost..

A comment indicating packet number and size precedes each packet dump.
Note that the commands are not applicable in raw mode and have no effect.
