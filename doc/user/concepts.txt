=== Modules

Modules are the building blocks of Snort.  They encapsulate the types of
data that many components need including parameters, peg counts, profiling,
builtin rules, and commands.  This allows Snort to handle them generically
and consistently.  You can learn quite a lot about any given module from
the command line.  For example, to see what stream_tcp is all about, do
this:

    $ snort --help-config stream_tcp

Modules are configured using Lua tables with the same name.  So the
stream_tcp module is configured with defaults like this:

    stream_tcp = { }

The earlier help output showed that the default session tracking timeout is
30 seconds.  To change that to 60 seconds, you can configure it this way:

    stream_tcp = { session_timeout = 60 }

Or this way:

    stream_tcp = { }
    stream_tcp.session_timeout = 60

More on parameters is given in the next section.

Other things to note about modules:

* Shutdown output will show the non-zero peg counts for all modules.  For
  example, if stream_tcp did anything, you would see the number of sessions
  processed among other things.

* Providing the builtin rules allows the documentation to include them
  automatically and also allows for autogenerating the rules at startup.

* Only a few module provide commands at this point, most notably the snort
  module.

=== Plugins

Snort uses a variety of plugins to accomplish much of its processing
objectives, including:

* Codec - to decode and encode packets
* Inspector - like Snort 2 preprocessors, for normalization, etc.
* IpsOption - for detection in Snort rules
* IpsAction - for custom actions
* Logger - for handling events
* Mpse - for fast pattern matching
* So - for dynamic rules

The power of plugins is that they have a very focused purpose and can be
created with relative ease.  For example, you can extend the rule language
by writing your own IpsOption and it will plug in and function just like
existing options.  The extra directory has examples of each type of plugin.

Most plugins can be built statically or dynamically.  By default they are
all static.  There is no difference in functionality between static or
dynamic plugins but the dynamic build generates a slightly lighter weight
binary.  Either way you can add dynamic plugins with --plugin-path and
newer versions will replace older versions, even when built statically.

A single dynamic library may contain more than one plugin.  For example, an
inspector will typically be packaged together with any associated rule
options.


=== Operation

Snort is a signature-based IPS, which means that as it receives network
packets it reassembles and normalizes the content so that a set of rules
can be evaluated to detect the presence of any significant conditions that
merit further action.  A rough processing flow is as follows:

////
(pkt) -> [decode] -> [preprocess] -> [detect] -> [log] -> (verdict)
////
image::snort2x.png["Snort 2",width="480"]

The steps are:

1.  Decode each packet to determine the basic network characteristics such
as source and destination addresses and ports.  A typical packet might have
ethernet containing IP containing TCP containing HTTP (ie eth:ip:tcp:http).
The various encapsulating protocols are examined for sanity and anomalies
as the packet is decoded.  This is essentially a stateless effort.

2.  Preprocess each decoded packet using accumulated state to determine the
purpose and content of the innermost message.  This step may involve
reordering and reassembling IP fragments and TCP segments to produce the
original application protocol data unit (PDU).  Such PDUs are analyzed and
normalized as needed to support further processing.

3.  Detection is a two step process.  For efficiency, most rules contain a
specific content pattern that can be searched for such that if no match is
found no further processing is necessary.  Upon start up, the rules are
compiled into pattern groups such that a single, parallel search can be
done for all patterns in the group.  If any match is found, the full rule
is examined according to the specifics of the signature.

4.  The logging step is where Snort saves any pertinent information
resulting from the earlier steps.  More generally, this is where other
actions can be taken as well such as blocking the packet.


==== Snort 2 Processing

The preprocess step in Snort 2 is highly configurable.  Arbitrary
preprocessors can be loaded dynamically at startup, configured in
snort.conf, and then executed at runtime.  Basically, the preprocessors are
put into a list which is iterated for each packet.  Recent versions have
tweaked the list handling some, but the same basic architecture has allowed
Snort 2 to grow from a sniffer, with no preprocessing, to a full-fledged
IPS, with lots of preprocessing.

While this "list of plugins" approach has considerable flexibility, it
hampers future development when the flow of data from one preprocessor to
the next depends on traffic conditions, a common situation with advanced
features like application identification.  In this case, a preprocessor
like HTTP may be extracting and normalizing data that ultimately is not
used, or appID may be repeatedly checking for data that is just not
available.

Callbacks help break out of the preprocess straitjacket.  This is where one
preprocessor supplies another with a function to call when certain data is
available.  Snort has started to take this approach to pass some HTTP and
SIP preprocessor data to appID.  However, it remains a peripheral feature
and still requires the production of data that may not be consumed.


==== Snort 3 Processing

One of the goals of Snort 3 is to provide a more flexible framework for
packet processing by implementing an event-driven approach.  Another is to
produce data only when needed to minimize expensive normalizations.
However, the basic packet processing provides very similar functionality.

The basic processing steps Snort 3 takes are similar to Snort 2 as seen
in the following diagram.  The preprocess step employs specific inspector
types instead of a generalized list, but the basic procedure includes
stateless packet decoding, TCP stream reassembly, and service specific
analysis in both cases.  (Snort 3 provides hooks for arbitrary inspectors,
but they are not central to basic flow processing and are not shown.)

////
(pkt) -> [decode] -> [stream] -> [service] -> [detect] -> [log] -> (verdict)
         -----------------------------------------------------
                      [appid]   [firewall]   [other]
////
image::snort3x.png["Snort 3",width="480"]

However, Snort 3 also provides a more flexible mechanism than callback
functions.  By using inspection events, it is possible for an inspector to
supply data that other inspectors can process.  This is known as the
observer pattern or publish-subscribe pattern.

Note that the data is not actually published.  Instead, access to the data
is published, and that means that subscribers can access the raw or
normalized version(s) as needed.  Normalizations are done only on the first
access, and subsequent accesses get the previously normalized data.  This
results in just in time (JIT) processing.

A basic example of this in action is provided by the extra data_log plugin.
It is a passive inspector, ie it does nothing until it receives the data it
subscribed for ('other' in the above diagram).  By adding the following to
your snort.lua configuration, you will get a simple URI logger.

    data_log = { key = 'http_raw_uri' }

Inspection events coupled with pluggable inspectors provide a very flexible
framework for implementing new features.  And JIT buffer stuffers allow
Snort to work smarter, not harder.  These capabilities will be leveraged
more and more as Snort development continues.


=== Rules

Rules tell Snort how to detect interesting conditions, such as an attack,
and what to do when the condition is detected.  Here is an example rule:

    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.1 80 ( msg:"A ha!"; content:"attack"; sid:1; )

The structure is:

    action proto source dir dest ( body )

Where:

action - tells Snort what to do when a rule "fires", ie when the signature
matches.  In this case Snort will log the event.  It can also do thing like
block the flow when running inline.

proto - tells Snort what protocol applies.  This may be ip, icmp, tcp, udp,
http, etc.

source - specifies the sending IP address and port, either of which can be
the keyword any, which is a wildcard.

dir - must be either unidirectional as above or bidirectional indicated by
<>.

dest - similar to source but indicates the receiving end.

body - detection and other information contained in parenthesis.

There are many rule options available to construct as sophisticated a
signature as needed.  In this case we are simply looking for the "attack"
in any TCP packet.  A better rule might look like this:

    alert http
    (
        msg:"Gotcha!";
        flow:established, to_server;
        http_uri:"attack";
        sid:2;
    )

Note that these examples have a sid option, which indicates the signature
ID.  In general rules are specified by gid:sid:rev notation, where gid is
the generator ID and rev is the revision of the rule.  By default, text
rules are gid 1 and shared-object (SO) rules are gid 3.  The various
components within Snort that generate events have 1XX gids, for example the
decoder is gid 116.  You can list the internal gids and sids with these
commands:

    $ snort --list-gids
    $ snort --list-builtin

For details on these and other options, see the reference section.

=== Pattern Matching

Snort evaluates rules in a two-step process which includes a fast pattern
search and full evaluation of the signature.  More details on this process
follow.

==== Rule Groups

When Snort starts or reloads configuration, rules are grouped by protocol,
port and service.  For example, all TCP rules using the HTTP_PORTS variable
will go in one group and all service HTTP rules will go in another group.
These rule groups are compiled into multipattern search engines (MPSE)
which are designed to search for all patterns with just a single pass
through a given packet or buffer.  You can select the algorithm to use for
fast pattern searches with search_engine.search_method which defaults to
'ac_bnfa', which balances speed and memory.  For a faster search at the
expense of significantly more memory, use 'ac_full'.  For best performance
and reasonable memory, download the hyperscan source from Intel.

==== Fast Patterns

Fast patterns are content strings that have the fast_pattern option or
which have been selected by Snort automatically to be used as a fast
pattern.  Snort will by default choose the longest pattern in the rule
since that is likely to be most unique.  That is not always the case so add
fast_pattern to the appropriate content option for best performance.  The
ideal fast pattern is one which, if found, is very likely to result in a
rule match.  Fast patterns that match frequently for unrelated traffic will
cause Snort to work hard with little to show for it.

Certain contents are not eligible to be used as fast patterns.
Specifically, if a content is negated, then if it is also relative to
another content, case sensitive, or has non-zero offset or depth, then it
is not eligible to be used as a fast pattern.

==== Rule Evaluation

For each fast pattern match, the corresponding rule(s) are evaluated
left-to-right.  Rule evaluation requires checking each detection option in
a rule and is a fairly costly process which is why fast patterns are so
important.  Rule evaluation aborts on the first non-matching option.

When rule evaluation takes place, the fast pattern match will automatically
be skipped if possible.  Note that this differs from Snort 2 which provided
the fast_pattern:only option to designate such cases.  This is one less
thing for the rule writer to worry about.
