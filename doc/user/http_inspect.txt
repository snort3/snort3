One of the major undertakings for Snort 3 is developing a completely new
HTTP inspector.

==== Overview

You can configure it by adding:

    http_inspect = {}

to your snort.lua configuration file. Or you can read about it in the
source code under src/service_inspectors/http_inspect.

So why a new HTTP inspector?

For starters it is object-oriented. That’s good for us because we maintain
this software. But it should also be really nice for open-source
developers. You can make meaningful changes and additions to HTTP
processing without having to understand the whole thing. In fact much of
the new HTTP inspector’s knowledge of HTTP is centralized in a series of
tables where it can be easily reviewed and modified. Many significant
changes can be made just by updating these tables.

http_inspect is the first inspector written specifically for the new
Snort 3 architecture. This provides access to one of the very best features
of Snort 3: purely PDU-based inspection. The classic preprocessor processes
HTTP messages, but even while doing so it is constantly aware of IP packets
and how they divide up the TCP data stream. The same HTTP message might be
processed differently depending on how the sender (bad guy) divided it up
into IP packets.

http_inspect is free of this burden and can focus exclusively on HTTP.
This makes it much simpler, easier to test, and less prone to false
positives. It also greatly reduces the opportunity for adversaries to probe
the inspector for weak spots by adjusting packet boundaries to disguise bad
behavior.

Dealing solely with HTTP messages also opens the door for developing major
new features. The http_inspect design supports true stateful processing.
Want to ask questions that involve both the client request and the server
response? Or different requests in the same session? These things are
possible.

http_inspect is taking a very different approach to HTTP header fields. The
classic preprocessor divides all the HTTP headers following the start line
into cookies and everything else. It normalizes the two pieces using a
generic process and puts them in buffers that one can write rules against.
There is some limited support for examining individual headers within the
inspector but it is very specific.

The new concept is that every header should be normalized in an appropriate
and specific way and individually made available for the user to write
rules against it. If for example a header is supposed to be a date then
normalization means put that date in a standard format.

==== Legacy and Enhanced Normalizers

Currently, there are Legacy and Enhanced Normalizers for JavaScript
normalization. Both normalizers are independent and can be configured
separately. The Legacy normalizer should be considered deprecated.
The Enhanced Normalizer is encouraged to use for JavaScript normalization
in the first place as we continue improving functionality and quality.

===== Legacy Normalizer

The Legacy Normalizer can normalize obfuscated data within the JavaScript
functions such as unescape, String.fromCharCode, decodeURI, and decodeURIComponent.
It also replaces consecutive whitespaces with a single space and normalizes
the plus by concatenating the strings. For more information on how to enable
Legacy Normalizer, check the http_inspect.normalize_javascript option. Legacy
Normalizer is deprecated preferably to use Enhanced Normalizer. After
supporting backward compatibility in the Enhanced Normalizer, Legacy Normalizer
will be removed.

===== Enhanced Normalizer

Having ips option 'js_data' in the rules automatically enables Enhanced
Normalizer. The Enhanced Normalizer can normalize inline/external scripts.
It supports scripts over multiple PDUs. It is a stateful JavaScript whitespace
and identifiers normalizer. All JavaScript identifier names, except those,
are from the list of built-in identifiers, will be substituted to unified
names with the following format: var_0000 -> var_ffff. Moreover, Normalizer
validates the syntax concerning ECMA-262 Standard, including scope tracking,
and checks for restrictions for contents of script elements (since it is
HTML-embedded JavaScript). For more information on how additionally configure
Enhanced Normalizer check the following http_inspect options: js_normalization_depth,
js_norm_identifier_depth, js_norm_max_tmpl_nest, js_norm_max_scope_depth,
js_norm_built_in_ident. Eventually Enhanced Normalizer will completely replace
Legacy Normalizer.

==== Configuration

Configuration can be as simple as adding:

    http_inspect = {}

to your snort.lua file. The default configuration provides a thorough
inspection and may be all that you need. But there are some options that
provide extra features, tweak how things are done, or conserve resources by
doing less.

===== request_depth and response_depth

These replace the flow depth parameters used by the old HTTP inspector but
they work differently.

The default is to inspect the entire HTTP message body. That's a very sound
approach but if your HTTP traffic includes many very large files such as
videos the load on Snort can become burdensome. Setting the request_depth
and response_depth parameters will limit the amount of body data that is
sent to the rule engine. For example:

    request_depth = 10000,
    response_depth = 80000,

would examine only the first 10000 bytes of POST, PUT, and other message
bodies sent by the client. Responses from the server would be limited to
80000 bytes.

These limits apply only to the message bodies. HTTP headers are always
completely inspected.

If you want to only inspect headers and no body, set the depth to 0. If
you want to inspect the entire body set the depth to -1 or simply omit the
depth parameter entirely because that is the default.

These limits have no effect on how much data is forwarded to file
processing.

===== script_detection

Script detection is a feature that enables Snort to more quickly detect and
block response messages containing malicious JavaScript. When
http_inspect detects the end of a script it immediately forwards the
available part of the message body for early detection. This enables
malicious Javascripts to be detected more quickly but consumes somewhat
more of the sensor's resources.

This feature is off by default. script_detection = true will activate it.

===== gzip

http_inspect by default decompresses deflate and gzip message bodies
before inspecting them. This feature can be turned off by unzip = false.
Turning off decompression provides a substantial performance improvement
but at a very high price. It is unlikely that any meaningful inspection of
message bodies will be possible. Effectively HTTP processing would be
limited to the headers.

===== normalize_utf

http_inspect will decode utf-8, utf-7, utf-16le, utf-16be, utf-32le, and
utf-32be in response message bodies based on the Content-Type header. This
feature is on by default: normalize_utf = false will deactivate it.

===== decompress_pdf

decompress_pdf = true will enable decompression of compressed portions of
PDF files encountered in a response body. http_inspect will examine the
response body for PDF files that are then parsed to locate PDF streams with
a single /FlateDecode filter. The compressed content is decompressed and
made available through the file data rule option.

===== decompress_swf

decompress_swf = true will enable decompression of compressed SWF (Adobe
Flash content) files encountered in a response body. The available
decompression modes are ’deflate’ and ’lzma’. http_inspect will search for
the file signatures CWS for Deflate/ZLIB and ZWS for LZMA. The compressed
content is decompressed and made available through the file data rule
option. The compressed SWF file signature is converted to FWS to indicate
an uncompressed file.

===== decompress_vba

decompress_vba = true will enable decompression of RLE (Run Length Encoding)
compressed vba (Visual Basic for Applications) macro data of MS Office 
files. The MS office files are PKZIP compressed which are parsed to locate 
the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) file embedded with the files 
containing RLE compressed vba macro data. The decompressed vba macro data is
then made available through the vba_data ips rule option.

===== normalize_javascript

normalize_javascript = true will enable legacy normalizer of JavaScript within
the HTTP response body. http_inspect looks for JavaScript by searching for
the <script> tag without a type. Obfuscated data within the JavaScript
functions such as unescape, String.fromCharCode, decodeURI, and
decodeURIComponent are normalized. The different encodings handled within
the unescape, decodeURI, or decodeURIComponent are %XX, %uXXXX, XX and
uXXXXi. http_inspect also replaces consecutive whitespaces with a single
space and normalizes the plus by concatenating the strings. Such normalizations
refer to basic JavaScript normalization.

===== js_normalization_depth

js_normalization_depth = N {-1 : max53} will set a number of input JavaScript
bytes to normalize. When the depth is reached, normalization will be stopped.
It's implemented per-script. By default js_normalization_depth = -1, will set
unlimited depth. The enhanced normalizer provides more precise whitespace
normalization of JavaScript, that removes all redundant whitespaces and line
terminators from the JavaScript syntax point of view (between identifier and
punctuator, between identifier and operator, etc.) according to ECMAScript 5.1
standard. Additionally, it performs normalization of JavaScript identifiers making
a substitution of unique names with unified names representation: var_0000:var_ffff.
The identifiers are variables and function names. The normalized data is available
through the js_data rule option.

===== js_norm_identifier_depth

js_norm_identifier_depth = N {0 : 65536} will set a number of unique
JavaScript identifiers to normalize. When the depth is reached, a built-in
alert is generated. Every HTTP Response has its own identifier substitution
context. Thus, all scripts from the same response will be normalized as if
they are a single script.. By default, the value is set to 65536, which
is the max allowed number of unique identifiers. The generated names are in
the range from var_0000 to var_ffff.

===== js_norm_max_tmpl_nest

js_norm_max_tmpl_nest = N {0 : 255} (default 32) is an option of the enhanced
JavaScript normalizer that determines the deepest level of nested template literals
to be processed. Introduced in ES6, template literals provide syntax to define
a literal multiline string, which can have arbitrary JavaScript substitutions,
that will be evaluated and inserted into the string. Such substitutions can be
nested, and require keeping track of every layer for proper normalization. This option
is present to limit the amount of memory dedicated to this tracking.

===== js_norm_max_scope_depth

js_norm_max_scope_depth = N {0 : 65535} (default 256) is an option of the enhanced
JavaScript normalizer that determines the deepest level of nested scope. The scope
term includes code sections("{}"), parentheses("()") and brackets("[]"). This option
is present to limit the amount of memory dedicated to this tracking.

===== js_norm_built_in_ident

js_norm_built_in_ident = {<the list of built-in JavaScript identifier names>}.
The default list is present in "snort_defaults.lua".

The built-in JavaScript identifiers will be placed as is, without substitution. Normalizer
tracks built-in identifier expressions based on the configured list of built-in names.
The built-in identifier expression is the built-in name (function or object) and the chain
of dot and bracket accessors after it, including the function calls.
For example:

    console.log("bar")
    document.getElementById("id").text
    eval("script")
    foo["bar"]

The list must contain object and function names only.
For example:

    http_inspect.js_norm_built_in_ident = { 'console', 'document', 'eval', 'foo' }

===== xff_headers

This configuration supports defining custom x-forwarded-for type headers. In a
multi-vendor world, it is quite possible that the header name carrying the
original client IP could be vendor-specific. This is due to the absence
of standardization which would otherwise standardize the header name.
In such a scenario, this configuration provides a way with which such headers
can be introduced to HI. The default value of this configuration
is "x-forwarded-for true-client-ip". The default definition introduces the
two commonly known headers and is preferred in the same order by the
inspector as they are defined, e.g "x-forwarded-for" will be preferred than
"true-client-ip" if both headers are present in the stream. The header names
should be delimited by a space.

===== maximum_host_length

Setting maximum_host_length causes http_inspect to generate 119:25 if the
Host header value including optional white space exceeds the specified length.
In the abnormal case of multiple Host headers, the total length of the combined
values is used. The default value is -1, meaning do not perform this check.

===== maximum_chunk_length

http_inspect strictly limits individual chunks within a chunked message
body to be less than four gigabytes.

A lower limit may be configured by setting maximum_chunk_length. Any chunk
longer than maximum chunk length will generate a 119:16 alert.

===== URI processing

Normalization and inspection of the URI in the HTTP request message is a
key aspect of what http_inspect does. The best way to normalize a URI is
very dependent on the idiosyncrasies of the HTTP server being accessed.
The goal is to interpret the URI the same way as the server will so that
nothing the server will see can be hidden from the rule engine.

The default URI inspection parameters are oriented toward following the
HTTP RFCs--reading the URI the way the standards say it should be read.
Most servers deviate from this ideal in various ways that can be exploited
by an attacker. The options provide tools for the user to cope with that.

    utf8 = true
    plus_to_space = true
    percent_u = false
    utf8_bare_byte = false
    iis_unicode = false
    iis_double_decode = true

The HTTP inspector normalizes percent encodings found in URIs. For instance
it will convert "%48%69%64%64%65%6e" to "Hidden". All the options listed
above control how this is done. The options listed as true are fairly
standard features that are decoded by default. You don't need to list them
in snort.lua unless you want to turn them off by setting them to false. But
that is not recommended unless you know what you are doing and have a
definite reason.

The other options are primarily for the protection of servers that support
irregular forms of decoding. These features are off by default but you can
activate them if you need to by setting them to true in snort.lua.

    bad_characters = "0x25 0x7e 0x6b 0x80 0x81 0x82 0x83 0x84"

That's a list of 8-bit Ascii characters that you don't want present in any
normalized URI after the percent decoding is done. For example 0x25 is a
hexadecimal number (37 in decimal) which stands for the '%' character. The
% character is legitimately used for encoding special characters in a URI.
But if there is still a percent after normalization one might conclude that
something is wrong. If you choose to configure 0x25 as a bad character
there will be an alert whenever this happens.

Another example is 0x00 which signifies the null character zero. Null
characters in a URI are generally wrong and very suspicious.

The default is not to alert on any of the 256 8-bit Ascii characters. Add
this option to your configuration if you want to define some bad
characters.

    ignore_unreserved = "abc123"

Percent encoding common characters such as letters and numbers that have no
special meaning in HTTP is suspicious. It's legal but why would you do it
unless you have something to hide? http_inspect will alert whenever an
upper-case or lower-case letter, a digit, period, underscore, tilde, or
minus is percent-encoded. But if a legitimate application in your
environment encodes some of these characters for some reason this allows
you to create exemptions for those characters.

In the example, the lower-case letters a, b, and c and the digits 1, 2, and
3 are exempted. These may be percent-encoded without generating an alert.

    simplify_path = true
    backslash_to_slash = true

HTTP inspector simplifies directory paths in URIs by eliminating extra
traversals using ., .., and /.

For example I can take a simple URI such as

    /very/easy/example

and complicate it like this:

    /very/../very/././././easy//////detour/to/nowhere/../.././../example

which may be very difficult to match with a detection rule. simplify_path
is on by default and you should not turn it off unless you have no interest
in URI paths.

backslash_to_slash is a tweak to path simplification for servers that allow
directories to be separated by backslashes:

    /this/is/the/normal/way/to/write/a/path

    \this\is\the\other\way\to\write\a\path

backslash_to_slash is turned on by default. It replaces all the backslashes
with slashes during normalization.

==== CONNECT processing

The HTTP CONNECT method is used by a client to establish a tunnel to a destination via an HTTP proxy
server. If the connection is successful the server will send a 2XX success response to the client,
then proceed to blindly forward traffic between the client and destination. That traffic belongs to
a new session between the client and destination and may be of any protocol, so clearly the HTTP
inspector will be unable to continue processing traffic following the CONNECT message as if it were
just a continuation of the original HTTP/1.1 session.

Therefore upon receiving a success response to a CONNECT request, the HTTP inspector will stop
inspecting the session. The next packet will return to the wizard, which will determine the
appropriate inspector to continue processing the flow. If the tunneled protocol happens to be
HTTP/1.1, the HTTP inspector will again start inspecting the flow, but as an entirely new session.

There is one scenario where the cutover to the wizard will not occur despite a 2XX success response
to a CONNECT request. HTTP allows for pipelining, or sending multiple requests without waiting for a
response. If the HTTP inspector sees any further traffic from the client after a CONNECT request
before it has seen the CONNECT response, it is unclear whether this traffic should be interpreted as
a pipelined HTTP request or tunnel traffic sent in anticipation of a success response from the
server. Due to this potential evasion tactic, the HTTP inspector will not cut over to the wizard if
it sees any early client-to-server traffic, but will continue normal HTTP processing of the flow
regardless of the eventual server response.

==== Trace messages

When a user needs help to sort out things going on inside HTTP inspector, Trace module becomes handy.

    $ snort --help-module trace | grep http_inspect

Messages for the enhanced JavaScript Normalizer follow
(more verbosity available in debug build):

===== trace.module.http_inspect.js_proc

Messages from script processing flow and their verbosity levels:

1. Script opening tag location.

2. Attributes of the detected script.

3. Return codes from Normalizer.

===== trace.module.http_inspect.js_dump

JavaScript data dump and verbosity levels:

1. js_data buffer as it is passed to detection.

2. (no messages available currently)

3. Current script as it is passed to Normalizer.

==== Detection rules

http_inspect parses HTTP messages into their components and makes them
available to the detection engine through rule options. Let's start with an
example:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"URI example"; flow:established,
    to_server; http_uri; content:"chocolate"; sid:1; rev:1; )

This rule looks for chocolate in the URI portion of the request message.
Specifically, the http_uri rule option is the normalized URI with all the
percent encodings removed. It will find chocolate in both:

    GET /chocolate/cake HTTP/1.1

and

    GET /%63%68$6F%63%6F%6C%61%74%65/%63%61%6B%65 HTTP/1.1

It is also possible to search the unnormalized URI

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"Raw URI example"; flow:established,
    to_server; http_raw_uri; content:"chocolate"; sid:2; rev:1; )

will match the first message but not the second. If you want to detect
someone who is trying to hide his request for chocolate then

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"Raw URI example"; flow:established,
    to_server; http_raw_uri; content:"%63%68$6F%63%6F%6C%61%74%65";
    sid:3; rev:1; )

will do the trick.

Let's look at possible ways of writing a rule to match HTTP response
messages with the Content-Language header set to "da" (Danish). You could
write:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"whole header search";
    flow:established, to_client; http_header; content:
    "Content-Language: da", nocase; sid:4; rev:1; )

This rule leaves much to be desired. Modern headers are often thousands of
bytes and seem to get longer every year. Searching all of the headers
consumes a lot of resources. Furthermore this rule is easily evaded:

    HTTP/1.1 ... Content-Language:  da ...

the extra space before the "da" throws the rule off. Or how about:

    HTTP/1.1 ... Content-Language: xx,da ...

By adding a made up second language the attacker has once again thwarted
the match.

A better way to write this rule is:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"individual header search";
    flow:established, to_client; http_header: field content-language;
    content:"da", nocase; sid:4; rev:2; )

The field option improves performance by narrowing the search to the
Content-Language field of the header. Because it uses the header parsing
abilities of http_inspect to find the field of interest it will not be
thrown off by extra spaces or other languages in the list.

In addition to the headers there are rule options for virtually every part
of the HTTP message.

===== http_uri and http_raw_uri

These provide the URI of the request message. The raw form is exactly as it
appeared in the message and the normalized form is determined by the URI
normalization options you selected. In addition to searching the entire URI
there are six components that can be searched individually:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"URI path"; flow:established,
    to_server; http_uri: path; content:"chocolate"; sid:1; rev:2; )

By specifying "path" the search is limited to the path portion of the URI.
Informally this is the part consisting of the directory path and file name.
Thus it will match:

    GET /chocolate/cake HTTP/1.1

but not:

    GET /book/recipes?chocolate+cake HTTP/1.1

The question mark ends the path and begins the query portion of the URI.
Informally the query is where parameter values are set and often contains a
search to be performed.

The six components are:

1. path: directory and file
2. query: user parameters
3. fragment: part of the file requested, normally found only inside a
   browser and not transmitted over the network
4. host: domain name of the server being addressed
5. port: TCP port number being addressed
6. scheme: normally "http" or "https" but others are possible such as "ftp"

Here is an example with all six:

    GET https://www.samplehost.com:287/basic/example/of/path?with-query
    #and-fragment HTTP/1.1\r\n

The URI is everything between the first space and the last space. "https"
is the scheme, "www.samplehost.com" is the host, "287" is the port,
"/basic/example/of/path" is the path, "with-query" is the query, and
"and-fragment" is the fragment.

http_uri represents the normalized uri, normalization of components depends 
on uri type. If the uri is of type absolute (contains all six components) or 
absolute path (contains path, query and fragment) then the path and query 
components are normalized. In these cases, http_uri represents the normalized
path, query, and fragment (/path?query#fragment). If the uri is of type 
authority (host and port), the host is normalized and http_uri represents the 
normalized host with the port number. In all other cases http_uri is the same 
as http_raw_uri.  

Note: this section uses informal language to explain some things. Nothing
here is intended to conflict with the technical language of the HTTP RFCs
and the implementation follows the RFCs.

===== http_header and http_raw_header

These cover all the header lines except the first one. You may specify an
individual header by name using the field option as shown in this earlier
example:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"individual header search";
    flow:established, to_client; http_header: field content-language;
    content:"da", nocase; sid:4; rev:2; )

This rule searches the value of the Content-Language header. Header names
are not case sensitive and may be written in the rule in any mixture of
upper and lower case.

With http_header the individual header value is normalized in a way that is
appropriate for that header.

If you don't specify a header you get all of the headers. http_raw_header
includes the unmodified header names and values as they appeared in the
original message. http_header is the same except percent encodings and cookies
are removed and paths are simplified exactly as if the headers were a URI.

In most cases specifying individual headers creates a more efficient and
accurate rule. It is recommended that new rules be written using individual
headers whenever possible.

===== http_trailer and http_raw_trailer

HTTP permits header lines to appear after a chunked body ends. Typically
they contain information about the message content that was not available
when the headers were created. For convenience we call them trailers.

http_trailer and http_raw_trailer are identical to their header
counterparts except they apply to these end headers. If you want a rule to
inspect both kinds of headers you need to write two rules, one using header
and one using trailer.

===== http_cookie and http_raw_cookie

These provide the value of the Cookie header for a request message and the
Set-Cookie for a response message. If multiple cookies are present they
will be concatenated into a comma-separated list.

Normalization for http_cookie is the same URI-style normalization applied
to http_header when no specific header is specified.

===== http_true_ip

This provides the original IP address of the client sending the request as
it was stored by a proxy in the request message headers. Specifically it
is the last IP address listed in the X-Forwarded-For, True-Client-IP or
any other custom x-forwarded-for type header. If multiple headers are present the
preference defined in xff_headers configuration is considered.

===== http_client_body

This is the body of a request message such as POST or PUT. Normalization
for http_client_body is the same URI-like normalization applied to
http_header when no specific header is specified.

===== http_raw_body

This is the body of a request or response message. It will be dechunked
and unzipped if applicable but will not be normalized in any other way.

===== http_method

The method field of a request message. Common values are "GET", "POST",
"OPTIONS", "HEAD", "DELETE", "PUT", "TRACE", and "CONNECT".

===== http_stat_code

The status code field of a response message. This is normally a 3-digit
number between 100 and 599. In this example it is 200.

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

===== http_stat_msg

The reason phrase field of a response message. This is the human-readable
text following the status code. "OK" in the previous example.

===== http_version

The protocol version information that appears on the first line of an HTTP
message. This is usually "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".

===== http_raw_request and http_raw_status

These are the unmodified first header line of the HTTP request and response
messages respectively. These rule options are a safety valve in case you
need to do something you cannot otherwise do. In most cases it is better to
use a rule option for a specific part of the first header line. For a
request message those are http_method, http_raw_uri, and http_version. For
a response message those are http_version, http_stat_code, and
http_stat_msg.

===== file_data

The file_data contains the normalized message body. This is the normalization
described above under gzip, normalize_utf, decompress_pdf, decompress_swf, and
normalize_javascript.

===== js_data

The js_data contains normalized JavaScript text collected from the whole PDU
(inline or external scripts). It requires the Enhanced Normalizer enabled:
http_inspect = { js_normalization_depth = N },
js_normalization_depth option is described above.
Despite what js_data has, file_data still contains the whole HTTP body
with an original JavaScript in it.

===== vba_data

The vba_data will contain the decompressed Visual Basic for Applications
(vba) macro data embedded in MS office files. It requires decompress_zip
and decompress_vba options enabled.

==== Timing issues and combining rule options

HTTP inspector is stateful. That means it is aware of a bigger picture than
the packet in front of it. It knows what all the pieces of a message are,
the dividing lines between one message and the next, which request message
triggered which response message, pipelines, and how many messages have
been sent over the current connection.

Some rules use a single rule option:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"URI example"; flow:established,
    to_server; http_uri; content:"chocolate"; sid:1; rev:1; )

Whenever a new URI is available this rule will be evaluated. Nothing
complicated about that, but suppose we use more than one rule option:

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"combined example"; flow:established,
    to_server; http_uri: with_body; content:"chocolate"; file_data;
    content:"sinister POST data"; sid:5; rev:1; )

The with_body option to http_uri causes the URI to be made available with
the message body. Use with_body for header-related rule options in rules
that also examine the message body.

The with_trailer option is analogous and causes an earlier message element
to be made available at the end of the message when the trailers following
a chunked body arrive.

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"double content-language";
    flow:established, to_client; http_header: with_trailer, field
    content-language; content:"da", nocase; http_trailer: field
    content-language; content:"en", nocase; sid:6; rev:1; )

This rule will alert if the Content-Language changes from Danish in the
headers to English in the trailers. The with_trailer option is essential to
make this rule work.

It is also possible to write rules that examine both the client request and
the server response to it.

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"request and response example";
    flow:established, to_client; http_uri: with_body; content:"chocolate";
    file_data; content:"white chocolate"; sid:7; rev:1; )

This rule looks for white chocolate in a response message body where the
URI of the request contained chocolate. Note that this is a "to_client"
rule that will alert on and potentially block a server response containing
white chocolate, but only if the client URI requested chocolate. If the
rule were rewritten "to_server" it would be nonsense and not work. Snort
cannot block a client request based on what the server response will be
because that has not happened yet.

Another point is "with_body" for http_uri. This ensures the rule works on
the entire response body. If we were looking for white chocolate in the
response headers this would not be necessary.

Response messages do not have a URI so there was only one thing http_uri
could have meant in the previous rule. It had to be referring to the
request message. Sometimes that is not so clear.

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"header ambiguity example 1";
    flow:established, to_client; http_header: with_body; content:
    "chocolate"; file_data; content:"white chocolate"; sid:8; rev:1; )

    alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"header ambiguity example 2";
    flow:established, to_client; http_header: with_body, request; content:
    "chocolate"; file_data; content:"white chocolate"; sid:8; rev:2; )

Our search for chocolate has moved from the URI to the message headers.
Both the request and response messages have headers--which one are we
asking about? Ambiguity is always resolved in favor of looking in the
current message which is the response. The first rule is looking for a
server response containing chocolate in the headers and white chocolate in
the body.

The second rule uses the "request" option to explicitly say that the
http_header to be searched is the request header.

Let's put all of this together. There are six opportunities to do
detection:

1. When the the request headers arrive. The request line and all of the
headers go through detection at the same time.

2. When sections of the request message body arrive. If you want to combine
this with something from the request line or headers you must use the
with_body option.

3. When the request trailers arrive. If you want to combine this with
something from the request line or headers you must use the with_trailer
option.

4. When the response headers arrive. The status line and all of the headers
go through detection at the same time. These may be combined with elements
from the request line, request headers, or request trailers. Where
ambiguity arises use the request option.

5. When sections of the response message body arrive. These may be combined
with the status line, response headers, request line, request headers, or
request trailers as described above.

6. When the response trailers arrive. Again these may be combined as
described above.

Message body sections can only go through detection at the time they are
received. Headers may be combined with later items but the body cannot.
