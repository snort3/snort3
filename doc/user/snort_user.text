  * Support proxy mode
  * Multi-tennant support
  * Incremental reload
  * New serialization of perf data and events
  * Enhanced rule processing
  * Windows support
  * Anomaly detection
  * and more!

The remainder of this section provides a high level survey of the
inputs, processing, and outputs available with Snort 3.0.

Snort++ is the project that is creating Snort 3.0. In this manual
"Snort" or "Snort 3" refers to the 3.0 version and earlier versions
will be referred to as "Snort 2" where the distinction is relevant.


1.1. First Steps

--------------

Snort can be configured to perform complex packet processing and deep
packet inspection but it is best start simply and work up to more
interesting tasks. Snort won’t do anything you didn’t specifically
ask it to do so it is safe to just try things out and see what
happens. Let’s start by just running Snort with no arguments:

$ snort

That will output usage information including some basic help
commands. You should run all of these commands now to see what is
available:

$ snort -V
$ snort -?
$ snort --help

Note that Snort has extensive command line help available so if
anything below isn’t clear, there is probably a way to get the exact
information you need from the command line.

Now let’s examine the packets in a capture file (pcap):

$ snort -r a.pcap

Snort will decode and count the packets in the file and output some
statistics. Note that the output excludes non-zero numbers so it is
easy to see what is there.

You may have noticed that there are command line options to limit the
number of packets examined or set a filter to select particular
packets. Now is a good time to experiment with those options.

If you want to see details on each packet, you can dump the packets
to console like this:

$ snort -r a.pcap -L dump

Add the -d option to see the TCP and UDP payload. Now let’s switch to
live traffic. Replace eth0 in the below command with an available
network interface:

$ snort -i eth0 -L dump

Unless the interface is taken down, Snort will just keep running, so
enter Control-C to terminate or use the -n option to limit the number
of packets.

Generally it is better to capture the packets for later analysis like
this:

$ snort -i eth0 -L pcap -n 10

Snort will write 10 packets to log.pcap.# where # is a timestamp
value. You can read these back with -r and dump to console or pcap
with -L. You get the idea.

Note that you can do similar things with other tools like tcpdump or
Wireshark however these commands are very useful when you want to
check your Snort setup.

The examples above use the default pcap DAQ. Snort supports non-pcap
interfaces as well via the DAQ (data acquisition) library. Other DAQs
provide additional functionality such as inline operation and/or
higher performance. There are even DAQs that support raw file
processing (ie without packets), socket processing, and plain text
packets. To load external DAQ libraries and see available DAQs or
select a particular DAQ use one of these commands:

$ snort --daq-dir <path> --daq-list
$ snort --daq-dir <path> --daq <type>

Be sure to put the --daq-dir option ahead of the --daq-list option or
the external DAQs won’t appear in the list.

To leverage intrusion detection features of Snort you will need to
provide some configuration details. The next section breaks down what
must be done.


1.2. Configuration

--------------

Effective configuration of Snort is done via the environment, command
line, a Lua configuration file, and a set of rules.

Note that backwards compatibility with Snort 2 was sacrificed to
obtain new and improved functionality. While Snort 3 leverages some
of the Snort 2 code base, a lot has changed. The configuration of
Snort 3 is done with Lua, so your old conf won’t work as is. Rules
are still text based but with syntax tweaks, so your 2.X rules must
be fixed up. However, snort2lua will help you convert your conf and
rules to the new format.

1.2.1. Command Line

A simple command line might look like this:

snort -c snort.lua -R cool.rules -r some.pcap -A cmg

To understand what that does, you can start by just running snort
with no arguments by running snort --help. Help for all configuration
and rule options is available via a suitable command line. In this
case:

-c snort.lua is the main configuration file. This is a Lua script
that is executed when loaded.

-R cool.rules contains some detection rules. You can write your own
or obtain them from Talos (native 3.0 rules are not yet available
from Talos so you must convert them with snort2lua). You can also put
your rules directly in your configuration file.

-r some.pcap tells Snort to read network traffic from the given
packet capture file. You could instead use -i eth0 to read from a
live interface. There many other options available too depending on
the DAQ you use.

-A cmg says to output intrusion events in "cmg" format, which has
basic header details followed by the payload in hex and text.

Command line options have precedence over Lua configuration files.
This can be used to make a custom run keeping all configuration files
unchanged:

--daq-batch-size=32

will override daq.batch_size value.

Notably, you can add to and/or override anything in your
configuration file by using the --lua command line option. For
example:

--lua 'ips = { enable_builtin_rules = true }'

will load the built-in decoder and inspector rules. In this case, ips
is overwritten with the config you see above. If you just want to
change the config given in your configuration file you would do it
like this:

--lua 'ips.enable_builtin_rules = true'

1.2.2. Configuration File

The configuration file gives you complete control over how Snort
processes packets. Start with the default snort.lua included in the
distribution because that contains some key ingredients. Note that
most of the configurations look like:

stream = { }

This means enable the stream module using internal defaults. To see
what those are, you could run:

snort --help-config stream

Snort is organized into a collection of builtin and plugin modules.
If a module has parameters, it is configured by a Lua table of the
same name. For example, we can see what the active module has to
offer with this command:

$ snort --help-module active

What: configure responses

Type: basic

Configuration:

int active.attempts = 0: number of TCP packets sent per response (with
varying sequence numbers) { 0:20 }

string active.device: use 'ip' for network layer responses or 'eth0' etc
for link layer

string active.dst_mac: use format '01:23:45:67:89:ab'

int active.max_responses = 0: maximum number of responses { 0: }

int active.min_interval = 255: minimum number of seconds between
responses { 1: }

This says active is a basic module that has several parameters. For
each, you will see:

type module.name = default: help { range }

For example, the active module has a max_responses parameter that
takes non-negative integer values and defaults to zero. We can change
that in Lua as follows:

active = { max_responses = 1 }

or:

active = { }
active.max_responses = 1

If we also wanted to limit retries to at least 5 seconds, we could
do:

active = { max_responses = 1, min_interval = 5 }

1.2.3. Lua Variables

The following Global Lua Variables are available when Snort is run
with a lua config using -c option.

  * SNORT_VERSION: points to a string containing snort version and
    build as follows:

    SNORT_VERSION = "3.0.2-x"

  * SNORT_MAJOR_VERSION: Snort version’s major number.

    SNORT_MAJOR_VERSION = 3

  * SNORT_MINOR_VERSION: Snort version’s minor number.

    SNORT_MINOR_VERSION = 0

  * SNORT_PATCH_VERSION: Snort version’s patch number.

    SNORT_PATCH_VERSION = 2

  * SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS: Snort dependencies version numbers table. If
    snort wasn’t built with some dependency, its value will be nil.

    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.DAQ = 3.0.7
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.LUAJIT = 2.1.0
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.OPENSSL = 3.0.5
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.LIBPCAP = 1.9.1
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.PCRE = 8.45
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.ZLIB = 1.2.11
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.HYPERSCAN = 5.4.8
    SNORT_DEP_VERSIONS.LZMA = 5.0.5

1.2.4. Whitelist

When Snort is run with the --warn-conf-strict option, warnings will
be generated for all Lua tables present in the configuration files
that do not map to Snort module names. Like with other warnings,
these will upgraded to errors when Snort is run in pedantic mode.

To dynamically add exceptions that should bypass this strict
validation, two Lua functions are made available to be called during
the evaluation of Snort configuration files: snort_whitelist_append()
and snort_whitelist_add_prefix(). Each function takes a
whitespace-delimited list, the former a list of exact table names and
the latter a list of table name prefixes to allow.

Examples: snort_whitelist_append("table1 table2")
snort_whitelist_add_prefix("local_ foobar_")

The accumulated contents of the whitelist (both exact and prefix)
will be dumped when Snort is run in verbose mode (-v).

1.2.5. Rules

Rules determine what Snort is looking for. They can be put directly
in your Lua configuration file with the ips module, on the command
line with --lua, or in external files. Generally you will have many
rules obtained from various sources such as Talos and loading
external files is the way to go so we will summarize that here. Add
this to your Lua configuration:

ips = { include = 'rules.txt' }

to load the external rules file named rules.txt. You can only specify
one file this way but rules files can include other rules files with
the include statement. In addition you can load rules like:

$ sort -c snort.lua -R rules.txt

You can use both approaches together.

1.2.6. Includes

Your configuration file may include other files, either directly via
Lua or via various parameters. Snort will find relative includes in
the following order:

 1. If you specify --include-path, this directory will be tried
    first.
 2. Snort will try the directory containing the including file.
 3. Snort will try the directory containing the -c configuration
    file.

Some things to keep in mind:

  * If you use the Lua dofile function, then you must specify
    absolute paths or paths relative to your working directory since
    Lua will execute the include before Snort sees the file contents.
  * For best results, use include in place of dofile. This function
    is provided to follow Snort’s include logic.
  * As of now, appid and reputation paths must be absolute or
    relative to the working directory. These will be updated in a
    future release.

1.2.7. Converting Your 2.X Configuration

If you have a working 2.X configuration snort2lua makes it easy to
get up and running with Snort 3. This tool will convert your
configuration and/or rules files automatically. You will want to
clean up the results and double check that it is doing exactly what
you need.

snort2lua -c snort.conf

The above command will generate snort.lua based on your 2.X
configuration. For more information and options for more
sophisticated use cases, see the Snort2Lua section later in the
manual.


1.3. Output

--------------

Snort can produce quite a lot of data. In the following we will
summarize the key aspects of the core output types. Additional data
such as from appid is covered later.

1.3.1. Basic Statistics

At shutdown, Snort will output various counts depending on
configuration and the traffic processed. Generally, you may see:

  * Packet Statistics - this includes data from the DAQ and decoders
    such as the number of packets received and number of UDP packets.
  * Module Statistics - each module tracks activity via a set of peg
    counts that indicate how many times something was observed or
    performed. This might include the number of HTTP GET requests
    processed and the number of TCP reset packets trimmed.
  * File Statistics - look here for a breakdown of file type, bytes,
    signatures.
  * Summary Statistics - this includes total runtime for packet
    processing and the packets per second. Profiling data will appear
    here as well if configured.

Note that only the non-zero counts are output. Run this to see the
available counts:

$ snort --help-counts

1.3.2. Alerts

If you configured rules, you will need to configure alerts to see the
details of detection events. Use the -A option like this:

$ snort -c snort.lua -r a.pcap -A cmg

There are many types of alert outputs possible. Here is a brief list:

  * -A cmg is the same as -A fast -d -e and will show information
    about the alert along with packet headers and payload.
  * -A u2 is the same as -A unified2 and will log events and
    triggering packets in a binary file that you can feed to other
    tools for post processing. Note that Snort 3 does not provide the
    raw packets for alerts on PDUs; you will get the actual buffer
    that alerted.
  * -A csv will output various fields in comma separated value
    format. This is entirely customizable and very useful for pcap
    analysis.

To see the available alert types, you can run this command:

$ snort --list-plugins | grep logger

1.3.3. Files and Paths

Note that output is specific to each packet thread. If you run 4
packet threads with u2 output, you will get 4 different u2 files. The
basic structure is:

<logdir>/[<run_prefix>][<id#>][<X>]<name>

where:

  * logdir is set with -l and defaults to ./
  * run_prefix is set with --run-prefix else not used
  * id# is the packet thread number that writes the file; with one
    packet thread, id# (zero) is omitted without --id-zero
  * X is / if you use --id-subdir, else _ if id# is used
  * name is based on module name that writes the file

Additional considerations:

  * There is no way to explicitly configure a full path to avoid
    issues with multiple packet threads.
  * All text mode outputs default to stdout

1.3.4. Performance Statistics

Still more data is available beyond the above.

  * By configuring the perf_monitor module you can capture a
    configurable set of peg counts during runtime. This is useful to
    feed to an external program so you can see what is happening
    without stopping Snort.
  * The profiler module allows you to track time and space used by
    module and rules. Use this data to tune your system for best
    performance. The output will show up under Summary Statistics at
    shutdown.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Concepts

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides background on essential aspects of Snort’s
operation.


2.1. Terminology

--------------

  * basic module: a module integrated into Snort that does not come
    from a plugin.
  * binder: inspector that maps configuration to traffic
  * builtin rules: codec and inspector rules for anomalies detected
    internally.
  * codec: short for coder / decoder. These plugins are used for
    basic protocol decoding, anomaly detection, and construction of
    active responses.
  * data module: an adjunct configuration plugin for use with certain
    inspectors.
  * dynamic rules: plugin rules loaded at runtime. See SO rules.
  * fast pattern: the content in an IPS rule that must be found by
    the search engine in order for a rule to be evaluated.
  * fast pattern matcher: see search engine.
  * hex: a type of protocol magic that the wizard uses to identify
    binary protocols.
  * inspector: plugin that processes packets (similar to the Snort 2
    preprocessor)
  * IPS: intrusion prevention system, like Snort.
  * IPS action: plugin that allows you to perform custom actions when
    events are generated. Unlike loggers, these are invoked before
    thresholding and can be used to control external agents or send
    active responses.
  * IPS option: this plugin is the building blocks of IPS rules.
  * logger: a plugin that performs output of events and packets.
    Events are thresholded before reaching loggers.
  * module: the user facing portion of a Snort component. Modules
    chiefly provide configuration parameters, but may also provide
    commands, builtin rules, profiling statistics, peg counts, etc.
    Note that not all modules are plugins and not all plugins have
    modules.
  * peg count: the number of times a given event or condition occurs.
  * plugin: one of several types of software components that can be
    loaded from a dynamic library when Snort starts up. Some plugins
    are coupled with the main engine in such a way that they must be
    built statically, but a newer version can be loaded dynamically.
  * search engine: a plugin that performs multipattern searching of
    packets and payload to find rules that should be evaluated. There
    are currently no specific modules, although there are several
    search engine plugins. Related configuration is done with the
    basic detection module. Aka fast pattern matcher.
  * SO rule: a IPS rule plugin that performs custom detection that
    can’t be done by a text rule. These rules typically do not have
    associated modules. SO comes from shared object, meaning dynamic
    library.
  * spell: a type of protocol magic that the wizard uses to identify
    ASCII protocols.
  * text rule: a rule loaded from the configuration that has a header
    and body. The header specifies action, protocol, source and
    destination IP addresses and ports, and direction. The body
    specifies detection and non-detection options.
  * wizard: inspector that applies protocol magic to determine which
    inspectors should be bound to traffic absent a port specific
    binding. See hex and spell.


2.2. Modules

--------------

Modules are the building blocks of Snort. They encapsulate the types
of data that many components need including parameters, peg counts,
profiling, builtin rules, and commands. This allows Snort to handle
them generically and consistently. You can learn quite a lot about
any given module from the command line. For example, to see what
stream_tcp is all about, do this:

$ snort --help-module stream_tcp

Modules are configured using Lua tables with the same name. So the
stream_tcp module is configured with defaults like this:

stream_tcp = { }

The earlier help output showed that the default session tracking
timeout is 30 seconds. To change that to 60 seconds, you can
configure it this way:

stream_tcp = { session_timeout = 60 }

Or this way:

stream_tcp = { }
stream_tcp.session_timeout = 60

More on parameters is given in the next section.

Other things to note about modules:

  * Shutdown output will show the non-zero peg counts for all
    modules. For example, if stream_tcp did anything, you would see
    the number of sessions processed among other things.
  * Providing the builtin rules allows the documentation to include
    them automatically and also allows for autogenerating the rules
    at startup.
  * Only a few module provide commands at this point, most notably
    the snort module.


2.3. Parameters

--------------

Parameters are given with this format:

type name = default: help { range }

The following types are used:

  * addr: any valid IP4 or IP6 address or CIDR
  * addr_list: a space separated list of addr values
  * bit_list: a list of consecutive integer values from 1 to the
    range maximum
  * bool: true or false
  * dynamic: a select type determined by loaded plugins
  * enum: a string selected from the given range
  * implied: an IPS rule option that takes no value but means true
  * int: a whole number in the given range
  * interval: a set of ints (see below)
  * ip4: an IP4 address or CIDR
  * mac: an ethernet address with the form 01:02:03:04:05:06
  * multi: one or more space separated strings from the given range
  * port: an int in the range 0:65535 indicating a TCP or UDP port
    number
  * real: a real number in the given range
  * select: a string selected from the given range
  * string: any string with no more than the given length, if any

The parameter name may be adorned in various ways to indicate
additional information about the type and use of the parameter:

  * For Lua configuration (not IPS rules), if the name ends with []
    it is a list item and can be repeated.
  * For IPS rules only, names starting with ~ indicate positional
    parameters. The names of such parameters do not appear in the
    rule.
  * IPS rules may also have a wild card parameter, which is indicated
    by a *. Used for unquoted, comma-separated lists such as service
    and metadata.
  * The snort module has command line options starting with a -. The
    options passed from command line override the options configured
    via snort module.
  * $ denotes variable names.

Some additional details to note:

  * Table and variable names are case sensitive; use lower case only.
  * String values are case sensitive too; use lower case only.
  * Numeric ranges may be of the form low:high where low and high are
    bounds included in the range. If either is omitted, there is no
    hard bound. E.g. 0: means any x where x >= 0.
  * Strings may have a numeric range indicating a length limit;
    otherwise there is no hard limit.
  * bit_list is typically used to store a set of byte, port, or VLAN
    ID values.
  * interval takes the form [operator]i, j<>k, or j<⇒k where i,j,k
    are integers and operator is one of =, !, != (same as !), <, ⇐,
    >, >=. j<>k means j < int < k and j<⇒k means j ⇐ int ⇐ k.
  * Ranges may use maxXX like { 1:max32 } since max32 is easier to
    read than 4294967295. To get the values of maxXX, use snort
    --help-limits.

Parameter limits:

  * max31 = 2147483647
  * max32 = 4294967295
  * max53 = 9007199254740992
  * maxSZ = 9007199254740992


2.4. Plugins

--------------

Snort uses a variety of plugins to accomplish much of its processing
objectives, including:

  * Codec - to decode and encode packets
  * Inspector - like Snort 2 preprocessors, for normalization, etc.
  * IpsOption - for detection in Snort rules
  * IpsAction - for custom actions
  * Logger - for handling events
  * Mpse - for fast pattern matching
  * So - for dynamic rules

The power of plugins is that they have a very focused purpose and can
be created with relative ease. For example, you can extend the rule
language by writing your own IpsOption and it will plug in and
function just like existing options. The extra directory has examples
of each type of plugin.

Most plugins can be built statically or dynamically. By default they
are all static. There is no difference in functionality between
static or dynamic plugins but the dynamic build generates a slightly
lighter weight binary. Either way you can add dynamic plugins with
--plugin-path and newer versions will replace older versions, even
when built statically.

A single dynamic library may contain more than one plugin. For
example, an inspector will typically be packaged together with any
associated rule options.


2.5. Operation

--------------

Snort is a signature-based IPS, which means that as it receives
network packets it reassembles and normalizes the content so that a
set of rules can be evaluated to detect the presence of any
significant conditions that merit further action. A rough processing
flow is as follows:

Snort 2

The steps are:

 1. Decode each packet to determine the basic network characteristics
    such as source and destination addresses and ports. A typical
    packet might have ethernet containing IP containing TCP
    containing HTTP (ie eth:ip:tcp:http). The various encapsulating
    protocols are examined for sanity and anomalies as the packet is
    decoded. This is essentially a stateless effort.
 2. Preprocess each decoded packet using accumulated state to
    determine the purpose and content of the innermost message. This
    step may involve reordering and reassembling IP fragments and TCP
    segments to produce the original application protocol data unit
    (PDU). Such PDUs are analyzed and normalized as needed to support
    further processing.
 3. Detection is a two step process. For efficiency, most rules
    contain a specific content pattern that can be searched for such
    that if no match is found no further processing is necessary.
    Upon start up, the rules are compiled into pattern groups such
    that a single, parallel search can be done for all patterns in
    the group. If any match is found, the full rule is examined
    according to the specifics of the signature.
 4. The logging step is where Snort saves any pertinent information
    resulting from the earlier steps. More generally, this is where
    other actions can be taken as well such as blocking the packet.

2.5.1. Snort 2 Processing

The preprocess step in Snort 2 is highly configurable. Arbitrary
preprocessors can be loaded dynamically at startup, configured in
snort.conf, and then executed at runtime. Basically, the
preprocessors are put into a list which is iterated for each packet.
Recent versions have tweaked the list handling some, but the same
basic architecture has allowed Snort 2 to grow from a sniffer, with
no preprocessing, to a full-fledged IPS, with lots of preprocessing.

While this "list of plugins" approach has considerable flexibility,
it hampers future development when the flow of data from one
preprocessor to the next depends on traffic conditions, a common
situation with advanced features like application identification. In
this case, a preprocessor like HTTP may be extracting and normalizing
data that ultimately is not used, or appID may be repeatedly checking
for data that is just not available.

Callbacks help break out of the preprocess straitjacket. This is
where one preprocessor supplies another with a function to call when
certain data is available. Snort has started to take this approach to
pass some HTTP and SIP preprocessor data to appID. However, it
remains a peripheral feature and still requires the production of
data that may not be consumed.

2.5.2. Snort 3 Processing

One of the goals of Snort 3 is to provide a more flexible framework
for packet processing by implementing an event-driven approach.
Another is to produce data only when needed to minimize expensive
normalizations. However, the basic packet processing provides very
similar functionality.

The basic processing steps Snort 3 takes are similar to Snort 2 as
seen in the following diagram. The preprocess step employs specific
inspector types instead of a generalized list, but the basic
procedure includes stateless packet decoding, TCP stream reassembly,
and service specific analysis in both cases. (Snort 3 provides hooks
for arbitrary inspectors, but they are not central to basic flow
processing and are not shown.)

Snort 3

However, Snort 3 also provides a more flexible mechanism than
callback functions. By using inspection events, it is possible for an
inspector to supply data that other inspectors can process. This is
known as the observer pattern or publish-subscribe pattern.

Note that the data is not actually published. Instead, access to the
data is published, and that means that subscribers can access the raw
or normalized version(s) as needed. Normalizations are done only on
the first access, and subsequent accesses get the previously
normalized data. This results in just in time (JIT) processing.

A basic example of this in action is provided by the extra data_log
plugin. It is a passive inspector, ie it does nothing until it
receives the data it subscribed for (other in the above diagram). By
adding the following to your snort.lua configuration, you will get a
simple URI logger.

data_log = { key = 'http_raw_uri' }

Inspection events coupled with pluggable inspectors provide a very
flexible framework for implementing new features. And JIT buffer
stuffers allow Snort to work smarter, not harder. These capabilities
will be leveraged more and more as Snort development continues.


2.6. Rules

--------------

Rules tell Snort how to detect interesting conditions, such as an
attack, and what to do when the condition is detected. Here is an
example rule:

alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.1 80 ( msg:"A ha!"; content:"attack"; sid:1; )

The structure is:

action proto source dir dest ( body )

Where:

action - tells Snort what to do when a rule "fires", ie when the
signature matches. In this case Snort will log the event. It can also
do thing like block the flow when running inline.

proto - tells Snort what protocol applies. This may be ip, icmp, tcp,
udp, http, etc.

source - specifies the sending IP address and port, either of which
can be the keyword any, which is a wildcard.

dir - must be either unidirectional as above or bidirectional
indicated by <>.

dest - similar to source but indicates the receiving end.

body - detection and other information contained in parenthesis.

There are many rule options available to construct as sophisticated a
signature as needed. In this case we are simply looking for the
"attack" in any TCP packet. A better rule might look like this:

alert http
(
    msg:"Gotcha!";
    flow:established, to_server;
    http_uri:"attack";
    sid:2;
)

Note that these examples have a sid option, which indicates the
signature ID. In general rules are specified by gid:sid:rev notation,
where gid is the generator ID and rev is the revision of the rule. By
default, text rules are gid 1 and shared-object (SO) rules are gid 3.
The various components within Snort that generate events have 1XX
gids, for example the decoder is gid 116. You can list the internal
gids and sids with these commands:

$ snort --list-gids
$ snort --list-builtin

For details on these and other options, see the reference section.


2.7. Pattern Matching

--------------

Snort evaluates rules in a two-step process which includes a fast
pattern search and full evaluation of the signature. More details on
this process follow.

2.7.1. Rule Groups

When Snort starts or reloads configuration, rules are grouped by
protocol, port and service. For example, all TCP rules using the
HTTP_PORTS variable will go in one group and all service HTTP rules
will go in another group. These rule groups are compiled into
multipattern search engines (MPSE) which are designed to search for
all patterns with just a single pass through a given packet or
buffer. You can select the algorithm to use for fast pattern searches
with search_engine.search_method which defaults to ac_bnfa, which
balances speed and memory. For a faster search at the expense of
significantly more memory, use ac_full. For best performance and
reasonable memory, download the hyperscan source from Intel.

2.7.2. Fast Patterns

Fast patterns are content strings that have the fast_pattern option
or which have been selected by Snort automatically to be used as a
fast pattern. Snort will by default choose the longest pattern in the
rule since that is likely to be most unique. That is not always the
case so add fast_pattern to the appropriate content option for best
performance. The ideal fast pattern is one which, if found, is very
likely to result in a rule match. Fast patterns that match frequently
for unrelated traffic will cause Snort to work hard with little to
show for it.

Certain contents are not eligible to be used as fast patterns.
Specifically, if a content is negated, then if it is also relative to
another content, case sensitive, or has non-zero offset or depth,
then it is not eligible to be used as a fast pattern.

2.7.3. Rule Evaluation

For each fast pattern match, the corresponding rule(s) are evaluated
left-to-right. Rule evaluation requires checking each detection
option in a rule and is a fairly costly process which is why fast
patterns are so important. Rule evaluation aborts on the first
non-matching option.

When rule evaluation takes place, the fast pattern match will
automatically be skipped if possible. Note that this differs from
Snort 2 which provided the fast_pattern:only option to designate such
cases. This is one less thing for the rule writer to worry about.

2.7.3.1. Stateful Evaluation

When data forms a kind of stream, e.g. contiguous byte flow (like a
file transferred over the network or byte sequence from TCP session
packets), the point of interest may be in a signature which spans
across packets (its parts lies in different data blocks). In this
case, the stateful evaluation becomes handy.

If rule evaluation starts in a packet and the cursor position is
moved beyond the current packet boundary, then the evaluation gets
paused and will resume later when more data become available to
finish the process.

Stateful evaluation is supported for the following buffers:

 1. pkt_data — as a sequence of TCP session bytes with respect to
    their direction (client-to-server, server-to-client)
 2. js_data — normalized JavaScript text from the same data transfer
    session
 3. file_data — the same file bytes, e.g. flows from different files
    do not overlap


---------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Building

--------------

  * Optionally built features are listed in the reference section.
  * Create an install path:

    export my_path=/path/to/snorty
    mkdir -p $my_path

  * If LibDAQ was installed to a custom, non-system path:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/libdaq/install/path/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

  * Now do one of the following:

     a. To build with cmake and make, run configure_cmake.sh. It will
        automatically create and populate a new subdirectory named 
        build.

        ./configure_cmake.sh --prefix=$my_path
        cd build
        make -j $(nproc)
        make install
        ln -s $my_path/conf $my_path/etc

     b. You can also specify a cmake project generator:

        ./configure_cmake.sh --generator=Xcode --prefix=$my_path

     c. Or use ccmake directly to configure and generate from an
        arbitrary build directory like one of these:

        ccmake -G Xcode /path/to/Snort++/tree
        open snort.xcodeproj

        ccmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" /path/to/Snort++/tree
        run eclipse and do File > Import > Existing Eclipse Project

  * To build with g++ on OS X where clang is installed, do this
    first:

    export CXX=g++


3.3. Running

--------------

Examples:

  * Get some help:

    $my_path/bin/snort --help
    $my_path/bin/snort --help-module suppress
    $my_path/bin/snort --help-config | grep thread

  * Examine and dump a pcap:

    $my_path/bin/snort -r <pcap>
    $my_path/bin/snort -L dump -d -e -q -r <pcap>

  * Verify config, with or w/o rules:

    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua
    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules

  * Run IDS mode. To keep it brief, look at the first n packets in
    each file:

    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules \
        -r <pcap> -A alert_test -n 100000

  * Let’s suppress 1:2123. We could edit the conf or just do this:

    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules \
        -r <pcap> -A alert_test -n 100000 --lua "suppress = { { gid = 1, sid = 2123 } }"

  * Go whole hog on a directory with multiple packet threads:

    $my_path/bin/snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules \
        --pcap-filter \*.pcap --pcap-dir <dir> -A alert_fast -n 1000 --max-packet-threads 8

For more examples, see the usage section.


3.4. Tips

--------------

One of the goals of Snort 3 is to make it easier to configure your
sensor. Here is a summary of tips and tricks you may find useful.

General Use

  * Snort tries hard not to error out too quickly. It will report
    multiple semantic errors.
  * Snort always assumes the simplest mode of operation. Eg, you can
    omit the -T option to validate the conf if you don’t provide a
    packet source.
  * Warnings are not emitted unless --warn-* is specified. --warn-all
    enables all warnings, and --pedantic makes such warnings fatal.
  * You can process multiple sources at one time by using the -z or
    --max-threads option.
  * To make it easy to find the important data, zero counts are not
    output at shutdown.
  * Load plugins from the command line with --plugin-path /path/to/
    install/lib.
  * You can process multiple sources at one time by using the -z or
    --max-threads option.
  * Unit tests are configured with --enable-unit-tests. They can then
    be run with snort --catch-test [tags]|all.
  * Benchmark tests are configured with --enable-benchmark-tests.
    They can then be run with snort --catch-test [tags]|all or built
    as a separate executable. It is also preferred to configure a
    non-debug build with optimizations enabled.

Lua Configuration

  * Some parameters could be configured via a command line option or
    snort module. In this case a command line option has the highest
    precedence, in turn, snort module configuration has precedence
    over other modules.
  * Configure the wizard and default bindings will be created based
    on configured inspectors. No need to explicitly bind ports in
    this case.
  * You can override or add to your Lua conf with the --lua command
    line option.
  * The Lua conf is a live script that is executed when loaded. You
    can add functions, grab environment variables, compute values,
    etc.
  * You can also rename symbols that you want to disable. For
    example, changing normalizer to Xnormalizer (an unknown symbol)
    will disable the normalizer. This can be easier than commenting
    in some cases.
  * By default, symbols unknown to Snort are silently ignored. You
    can generate warnings for them with --warn-unknown. To ignore
    such symbols, export them in the environment variable
    SNORT_IGNORE.

Writing and Loading Rules

Snort rules allow arbitrary whitespace. Multi-line rules make it
easier to structure your rule for clarity. There are multiple ways to
add comments to your rules:

  * The # character starts a comment to end of line. In addition, all
    lines between #begin and #end are comments.
  * The rem option allows you to write a comment that is conveyed
    with the rule.
  * C style multi-line comments are allowed, which means you can
    comment out portions of a rule while testing it out by putting
    the options between /* and */.

There are multiple ways to load rules too:

  * Set ips.rules or ips.include.
  * include statements can be used in rules files.
  * Use -R to load a rules file.
  * Use --stdin-rules with command line redirection.
  * Use --lua to specify one or more rules as a command line
    argument.

Ips states are similar to ips rules, except that they are parsed
after the rules. That way rules can be overwritten in custom
policies.

States without the enable option are loaded as stub rules with
default gid:0, sid:0. A user should specify gid, sid, enable options
to avoid dummy rules.

Output Files

To make it simple to configure outputs when you run with multiple
packet threads, output files are not explicitly configured. Instead,
you can use the options below to format the paths:

<logdir>/[<run_prefix>][<id#>][<X>]<name>

  * logdir is set with -l and defaults to ./
  * run_prefix is set with --run-prefix else not used
  * id# is the packet thread number that writes the file; with one
    packet thread, id# (zero) is omitted without --id-zero
  * X is / if you use --id-subdir, else _ if id# is used
  * name is based on module name that writes the file
  * all text mode outputs default to stdout


3.5. Common Errors

--------------

PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (cannot open
snort_defaults.lua: No such file or directory)

  * export SNORT_LUA_PATH to point to any dofiles

ERROR can’t find xyz

  * if xyz is the name of a module, make sure you are not assigning a
    scalar where a table is required (e.g. xyz = 2 should be xyz = {
    }).

ERROR can’t find x.y

  * module x does not have a parameter named y. check --help-module x
    for available parameters.

ERROR invalid x.y = z

  * the value z is out of range for x.y. check --help-config x.y for
    the range allowed.

ERROR: x = { y = z } is in conf but is not being applied

  * make sure that x = { } isn’t set later because it will override
    the earlier setting. same for x.y.

FATAL: can’t load lua/errors.lua: lua/errors.lua:68: = expected near
';'

  * this is a syntax error reported by Lua to Snort on line 68 of
    errors.lua.

ERROR: rules(2) unknown rule keyword: find.

  * this was due to not including the --script-path.

WARNING: unknown symbol x

  * if you any variables, you can squelch such warnings by setting
    them in an environment variable SNORT_IGNORE. to ignore x, y, and
    z:

    export SNORT_IGNORE="x y z"


3.6. Gotchas

--------------

  * A nil key in a table will not be caught. Neither will a nil value
    in a table. Neither of the following will cause errors, nor will
    they actually set http_inspect.request_depth:

    http_inspect = { request_depth }
    http_inspect = { request_depth = undefined_symbol }

  * It is not an error to set a value multiple times. The actual
    value applied may not be the last in the table either. It is best
    to avoid such cases.

    http_inspect =
    {
        request_depth = 1234,
        request_depth = 4321
    }

  * Snort can’t tell you the exact filename or line number of a
    semantic error but it will tell you the fully qualified name.


3.7. Known Issues

--------------

  * The dump DAQ will not work with multiple threads unless you use
    --daq-var output=none. This will be fixed at some point to use
    the Snort log directory, etc.
  * If you build with hyperscan on OS X and see:

    dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libhs.4.0.dylib

    when you try to run src/snort, export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH with the path to
    libhs.  You can also do:

    install_name_tool -change @rpath/libhs.4.0.dylib \
        /path-to/libhs.4.0.dylib src/snort

  * Snort built with tcmalloc support (--enable-tcmalloc) on Ubuntu
    17.04/18.04 crashes immediately.

    Workaround:
    Uninstall gperftools 2.5 provided by the distribution and install gperftools
    2.7 before building Snort.

3.7.1. Reload Limitations

The following parameters can’t be changed during reload, and require
a restart:

  * active.attempts
  * active.device
  * alerts.detection_filter_memcap
  * alerts.event_filter_memcap
  * alerts.rate_filter_memcap
  * attribute_table.max_hosts
  * attribute_table.max_services_per_host
  * daq.snaplen
  * detection.asn1
  * file_id.max_files_cached
  * process.chroot
  * process.daemon
  * process.set_gid
  * process.set_uid
  * snort.--bpf
  * snort.-l
  * trace.output

In addition, the following scenarios require a restart:

  * Enabling file capture for the first time
  * Changing file_id.capture_memcap if file capture was previously or
    currently enabled
  * Changing file_id.capture_block_size if file capture was
    previously or currently enabled
  * Adding/removing stream_* inspectors if stream was already
    configured

In all of these cases reload will fail with the following message:
"reload failed - restart required". The original config will remain
in use.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Usage

---------------------------------------------------------------------

For the following examples "$my_path" is assumed to be the path to
the Snort install directory. Additionally, it is assumed that
"$my_path/bin" is in your PATH.


4.1. Help

--------------

Print the help summary:

snort --help

Get help on a specific module ("stream", for example):

snort --help-module stream

Get help on the "-A" command line option:

snort --help-options A

Grep for help on threads:

snort --help-config | grep thread

Output help on "rule" options in AsciiDoc format:

snort --markup --help-options rule

Note

Snort stops reading command-line options after the "--help-" and
"--list-" options, so any other options should be placed before them.


4.2. Sniffing and Logging

--------------

Read a pcap:

snort -r /path/to/my.pcap

Dump the packets to stdout:

snort -r /path/to/my.pcap -L dump

Dump packets with application data and layer 2 headers

snort -r /path/to/my.pcap -L dump -d -e

Note

Command line options must be specified separately. "snort -de" won’t
work. You can still concatenate options and their arguments, however,
so "snort -Ldump" will work.

Dump packets from all pcaps in a directory:

snort --pcap-dir /path/to/pcap/dir --pcap-filter '*.pcap' -L dump -d -e

Log packets to a directory:

snort --pcap-dir /path/to/pcap/dir --pcap-filter '*.pcap' -L dump -l /path/to/log/dir


4.3. Configuration

--------------

Validate a configuration file:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua

Validate a configuration file and a separate rules file:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -R $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules

Read rules from stdin and validate:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua --stdin-rules < $my_path/etc/snort/sample.rules

Enable warnings for Lua configurations and make warnings fatal:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua --warn-all --pedantic

Tell Snort where to look for additional Lua scripts:

snort --script-path /path/to/script/dir


4.4. IDS mode

--------------

Run Snort in IDS mode, reading packets from a pcap:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap

Log any generated alerts to the console using the "-A" option:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap -A alert_full

Capture separate stdout, stderr, and stdlog files (out has startup
and shutdown output, err has warnings and errors, and log has
alerts):

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap -A csv \
    1>out 2>err 3>log

Add or modify a configuration from the command line using the "--lua"
option:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap -A cmg \
    --lua 'ips = { enable_builtin_rules = true }'

Note

The "--lua" option can be specified multiple times.

Run Snort in IDS mode on an entire directory of pcaps, processing
each input source on a separate thread:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua --pcap-dir /path/to/pcap/dir \
    --pcap-filter '*.pcap' --max-packet-threads 8

Run Snort on 2 interfaces, eth0 and eth1:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -i "eth0 eth1" -z 2 -A cmg

Run Snort inline with the afpacket DAQ:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua --daq afpacket -i "eth0:eth1" \
    -A cmg


4.5. Plugins

--------------

Load external plugins and use the "ex" alert:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --plugin-path $my_path/lib/snort_extra \
    -A alert_ex -r /path/to/my.pcap

Test the LuaJIT rule option find loaded from stdin:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --script-path $my_path/lib/snort_extra \
    --stdin-rules -A cmg -r /path/to/my.pcap << END
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (
    sid:3; msg:"found"; content:"GET";
    find:"pat='HTTP/1%.%d'" ; )
END


4.6. Output Files

--------------

To make it simple to configure outputs when you run with multiple
packet threads, output files are not explicitly configured. Instead,
you can use the options below to format the paths:

<logdir>/[<run_prefix>][<id#>][<X>]<name>

Log to unified in the current directory:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap -A unified2

Log to unified in the current directory with a different prefix:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap -A unified2 \
    --run-prefix take2

Log to unified in /tmp:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -r /path/to/my.pcap -A unified2 -l /tmp

Run 4 packet threads and log with thread number prefix (0-3):

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua --pcap-dir /path/to/pcap/dir \
    --pcap-filter '*.pcap' -z 4 -A unified2

Run 4 packet threads and log in thread number subdirs (0-3):

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua --pcap-dir /path/to/pcap/dir \
    --pcap-filter '*.pcap' -z 4 -A unified2 --id-subdir

Note

subdirectories are created automatically if required. Log filename is
based on module name that writes the file. All text mode outputs
default to stdout. These options can be combined.


4.7. DAQ Alternatives

--------------

Process hext packets from stdin:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --daq-dir $my_path/lib/snort/daqs --daq hext -i tty << END
$packet 10.1.2.3 48620 -> 10.9.8.7 80
"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
"Host: localhost\r\n"
"\r\n"
END

Process raw ethernet from hext file:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --daq-dir $my_path/lib/snort/daqs --daq hext \
    --daq-var dlt=1 -r <hext-file>

Process a directory of plain files (ie non-pcap) with 4 threads with
8K buffers:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --daq-dir $my_path/lib/snort/daqs --daq file \
    --pcap-dir path/to/files -z 4 -s 8192

Bridge two TCP connections on port 8000 and inspect the traffic:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --daq-dir $my_path/lib/snort/daqs --daq socket


4.8. Logger Alternatives

--------------

Dump TCP stream payload in hext mode:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -L hext

Output timestamp, pkt_num, proto, pkt_gen, dgm_len, dir, src_ap,
dst_ap, rule, action for each alert:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua -A csv

Output the old test format alerts:

snort -c $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua \
    --lua "alert_csv = { fields = 'pkt_num gid sid rev', separator = '\t' }"


4.9. Shell

--------------

You must build with --enable-shell to make the command line shell
available.

Enable shell mode:

snort --shell <args>

You will see the shell mode command prompt, which looks like this:

o")~

(The prompt can be changed with the SNORT_PROMPT environment
variable.)

You can pause immediately after loading the configuration and again
before exiting with:

snort --shell --pause <args>

In that case you must issue the resume() command to continue. Enter
quit() to terminate Snort or detach() to exit the shell. You can list
the available commands with help().

To enable local telnet access on port 12345:

snort --shell -j 12345 <args>

The command line interface is still under development. Suggestions
are welcome.


4.10. Signals

--------------

Note

The following examples assume that Snort is currently running and has
a process ID of <pid>.

Modify and Reload Configuration:

echo 'suppress = { { gid = 1, sid = 2215 } }' >> $my_path/etc/snort/snort.lua
kill -hup <pid>

Dump stats to stdout:

kill -usr1 <pid>

Shutdown normally:

kill -term <pid>

Exit without flushing packets:

kill -quit <pid>

List available signals:

snort --help-signals

Note

The available signals may vary from platform to platform.

5. Features

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This section explains how to use key features of Snort.


5.1. Active Response

--------------

Snort can take more active role in securing network by sending active
responses to shutdown offending sessions. When active responses is
enabled, snort will send TCP RST and ICMP unreachable when dropping a
TCP session and ICMP unreachable packets for UDP.

5.1.1. Changes from Snort 2.9

  * stream5_global:max_active_responses and min_response_seconds are
    now active.max_responses and active.min_interval.
  * Response actions were removed from IPS rule body to the rule
    action in the header. This includes react, reject, and rewrite
    (split out of replace which now just does the detection part).
    These IPS actions are plugins.
  * drop and block are synonymous in Snort 2.9 but in Snort 3.0 drop
    means don’t forward the current packet only whereas block means
    don’t forward this or any following packet on the flow.

5.1.2. Configure Active

Active response is enabled by configuring one of following IPS action
plugins:

react = { }
reject = { }

When these active responses are not configured the default
configuration is used.

Active responses will be performed for reject, react or rewrite IPS
rule actions, and response packets are encoded based on the
triggering packet. TTL will be set to the value captured at session
pickup.

Configure the number of attempts to land a TCP RST within the
session’s current window (so that it is accepted by the receiving
TCP). This sequence "strafing" is really only useful in passive mode.
In inline mode the reset is put straight into the stream in lieu of
the triggering packet so strafing is not necessary.

Each attempt (sent in rapid succession) has a different sequence
number. Each active response will actually cause this number of TCP
resets to be sent. TCP data is multiplied similarly. At most 1 ICMP
unreachable is sent, iff attempts > 0.

Device IP will perform network layer injection. It is probably a
better choice to specify an interface and avoid kernel routing
tables, etc.

dst_mac will change response destination MAC address, if the device
is eth0, eth1, eth2 etc. Otherwise, response destination MAC address
is derived from packet.

Example:

active =
{
    attempts = 2,
    device = "eth0",
    dst_mac = "00:06:76:DD:5F:E3",
}

5.1.3. Reject

IPS action reject perform active response to shutdown hostile network
session by injecting TCP resets and ICMP unreachable for TCP
connections, and ICMP unreachable packets for UDP.

Example:

reject = { reset = "both", control = "all" }

local_rules =
[[
reject tcp ( msg:"hostile connection"; flow:established, to_server;
content:"HACK!"; sid:1; )
]]

ips =
{
    rules = local_rules,
}

5.1.4. React

IPS action react enables sending an HTML page on a session and then
resetting it.

The headers used are:

"HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\n" \
"Connection: close\r\n" \
"Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n" \
"Content-Length: 438\r\n" \
"\r\n"

The page to be sent can be read from a file:

react = { page = "customized_block_page.html", }

or else the default is used:

"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN\"\r\n" \
"    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd\">\r\n" \
"<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\">\r\n" \
"<head>\r\n" \
"<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />\r\n" \
"<title>Access Denied</title>\r\n" \
"</head>\r\n" \
"<body>\r\n" \
"<h1>Access Denied</h1>\r\n" \
"<p>You are attempting to access a forbidden site.<br />" \
"Consult your system administrator for details.</p>\r\n" \
"</body>\r\n" \
"</html>\r\n"

Note that the file contains the message body only. The headers will
be added with an updated value for Content-Length. For HTTP/2 traffic
Snort will translate the page to HTTP/2 format.

Limitations for HTTP/2:

  * Packet will be injected against the last received stream id.
  * Injection triggered while server-to-client flow of traffic is in
    a middle of a frame is not supported. The traffic will be
    blocked, but the page will not be injected/displayed.

When using react, payload injector must be configured as well. Also
Snort should be in ips mode, so the rule is triggered on the client
packet, and not delayed until the server sends ACK. To achieve this
use the default normalizer. It will set normalizer.tcp.ips = true.
Example:

react = { page = "my_block_page.html" }
payload_injector = { }
normalizer = { }

local_rules =
[[
react http ( msg:"Unauthorized Access Prohibited!"; flow:established,
to_server; http_method; content:"GET"; sid:1; )
]]

ips =
{
    rules = local_rules,
}

React has debug trace functionality. It can be used to get traces in
case injection is not successful. To turn it on:

trace =
{
    modules = { react = { all = 1 } }
}

5.1.5. Rewrite

IPS action "rewrite" enables overwrite packet contents based on
"replace" option in the rules. Note that using "rewrite" action
without "replace" option will raise corresponding rule alert, but
will not overwrite the packet payload.

For example:

local_rules =
[[
rewrite tcp 10.1.1.87 any -> 10.1.1.0/24 80
(
    sid:1000002;
    msg:"test replace rule";
    content:"index.php", nocase;
    replace:"indax.php";
)
]]

ips =
{
    rules = local_rules,
}

this rule replaces the first occurrence of "index.php" with
"indax.php", and "rewrite" action updates that packet.

Content and replacement are aligned to the right side of the matching
content and are limited not by the size of the matching content, but
by the boundaries of the packet.

Example:

rewrite http any any -> any any
(
    msg:"Small replace";
    content:"content";
    replace:"text";
    sid:1000002;
)

this rule replaces "malicious content" to "malicious context".

Example:

rewrite http any any -> any any
(
    msg:"Big replace";
    content:"content";
    replace:"y favorite page!";
    sid:1000002;
)

this rule replaces "malicious content" to "my favorite page!".

Be aware that after the match there should be enough room left for
the "replace" content in the matched packet. If there is not enough
space for the "replace" content the rule will not match.

"replace" works for raw packets only. So, TCP data must either fit
under the "pkt_data" buffer requirements or one should enable
detection on TCP payload before reassembly:
search_engine.detect_raw_tcp=true. For example:

Rule that does not require search_engine.detect_raw_tcp=true:

rewrite udp any any -> any any
(
    msg:"TEST 1";
    sid:1000002;
    content:"attack";
    replace:"abc123";
)

Rule that does require search_engine.detect_raw_tcp=true:

rewrite http any any -> any any
(
    msg:"TEST 2";
    content:"/content.html";
    replace:"/replace.html";
    sid:1000002;
)


5.2. AppId

--------------

Network administrators need application awareness in order to fine
tune their management of the ever-growing number of applications
passing traffic over the network. Application awareness allows an
administrator to create rules for applications as needed by the
business. The rules can be used to take action based on the
application, such as block, allow or alert.

5.2.1. Overview

The AppId inspector provides an application level view when managing
networks by providing the following features:

  * Network control: The inspector works with Snort rules by
    providing a set of application identifiers (AppIds) to Snort rule
    writers.
  * Application usage awareness: The inspector outputs statistics to
    show how many times applications are being used on the network.
  * Custom applications: Administrators can create their own
    application detectors to detect new applications. The detectors
    are written in Lua and interface with Snort using a well-defined
    C-Lua API.
  * Open Detector Package (ODP): A set of pre-defined application
    detectors are provided by the Snort team and can be downloaded
    from snort.org.

5.2.2. Dependency Requirements

For proper functioning of the AppId inspector, at a minimum stream
flow tracking must be enabled. In addition, to identify TCP-based or
UDP-based applications, the appropriate stream inspector must be
enabled, e.g. stream_tcp or stream_udp.

In order to identify HTTP-based applications, the HTTP inspector must
be enabled. Otherwise, only non-HTTP applications will be identified.

AppId subscribes to the inspection events published by other
inspectors, such as the HTTP and SSL inspectors, to gain access to
the data needed. It uses that data to help determine the application
ID.

AppId subscribes to the events published by SIP and DCE/RPC
inspectors to detect applications on expected flows.

5.2.3. Configuration

The AppId feature can be enabled via configuration. To enable it with
the default settings use:

appid = { }

To use an AppId as a matching parameter in an IPS rule, use the 
appids keyword. For example, to block HTTP traffic that contains a
specific header:

block tcp any any -> 192.168.0.1 any ( msg:"Block Malicious HTTP header";
  appids:"HTTP"; content:"X-Header: malicious"; sid:18000; )

Alternatively, the HTTP application can be specified in place of tcp
instead of using the appids keyword. The AppId inspector will set the
service when it is discovered so it can be used in IPS rules like
this. Note that this rule also does not specify the IPs or ports
which default to any.

block http ( msg:"Block Malicious HTTP header";
  content:"X-Header: malicious"; sid:18000; )

It’s possible to specify multiple applications (as many as desired)
with the appids keyword. A rule is considered a match if any of the
applications on the rule match. Note that this rule does not match
specific content which will reduce performance.

alert tcp any any -> 192.168.0.1 any ( msg:"Alert ";
  appids:"telnet,ssh,smtp,http";

Below is a minimal Snort configuration that is sufficient to block
flows based on a specific HTTP header:

stream = { }

stream_tcp = { }

binder =
{
    {
        when =
        {
            proto = 'tcp',
            ports = [[ 80 8080 ]],
        },
        use =
        {
            type = 'http_inspect',
        },
    },
}

http_inspect = { }

appid = { }

local_rules =
[[
block http ( msg:"openAppId: test content match for app http";
content:"X-Header: malicious"; sid:18760; rev:4; )
]]

ips =
{
    rules = local_rules,
}

5.2.4. Session Application Identifiers

There are up to four AppIds stored in a session as defined below:

  * serviceAppId - An appId associated with server side of a session.
    Example: http server.
  * clientAppId - An appId associated with application on client side
    of a session. Example: Firefox.
  * payloadAppId - For services like http this appId is associated
    with a webserver host. Example: Facebook.
  * miscAppId - For some encapsulated protocols, this is the highest
    encapsulated application.

For packets originating from the client, a payloadAppid in a session
is matched with all AppIds listed on a rule. Thereafter miscAppId,
clientAppId and serviceAppId are matched. Since Alert Events contain
one AppId, only the first match is reported. If a rule without an
appids option matches, then the most specific appId (in order of
payload, misc, client, server) is reported.

The same logic is followed for packets originating from the server
with one exception. The order of matching is changed to make
serviceAppId come before clientAppId.

5.2.5. AppId Usage Statistics

The AppId inspector prints application network usage periodically in
the snort log directory in unified2 format. File name, time interval
for statistic and file rollover are controlled by appId inspection
configuration.

5.2.6. Open Detector Package (ODP) Installation

Application detectors from Snort team will be delivered in a separate
package called the Open Detector Package (ODP) that can be downloaded
from snort.org. ODP is a package that contains the following
artifacts:

  * Application detectors in the Lua language.
  * appMapping.data file containing application metadata. This file
    should not be modified. The first column contains application
    identifier and second column contains application name. Other
    columns contain internal information.
  * Lua library file DetectorCommon.lua.

A user can install the ODP package in any directory and configure
this directory via the app_detector_dir option in the appid
preprocessor configuration. Installing ODP will not modify any
subdirectory named custom, where user-created detectors are located.

When installed, ODP will create following sub-directories:

  * odp/lua //Cisco Lua detectors
  * odp/libs //Cisco Lua modules

5.2.7. User Created Application Detectors

Users can detect new applications by adding detectors in the Lua
language. A document will be posted on the Snort Website with details
on API. Users can also copy over Snort team provided detectors and
modify them. Users can also use the detector creation tool described
in the next section.

Users must organize their Lua detectors and libraries by creating the
following directory structure, under the ODP installation directory.

  * custom/lua //Lua detectors
  * custom/libs //Lua modules

The root path is specified by the "app_detector_dir" parameter of the
appid section of snort.conf:

appid  =
{
    app_detector_dir = '/usr/local/lib/openappid',
}

So the path to the user-created lua files would be /usr/local/lib/
openappid/custom/lua/

None of the directories below /usr/local/lib/openappid/ would be
added for you.

5.2.8. Application Detector Reload

Both ODP detectors and user created detectors can be reloaded using
the command appid.reload_detectors(). Detectors are expected to be
updated in the path appid.app_detector_dir before this command is
issued. The command takes no parameters.

5.2.9. Application Detector Creation Tool

For rudimentary Lua detectors, there is a tool provided called
appid_detector_builder.sh. This is a simple, menu-driven bash script
which creates .lua files in your current directory, based on your
choices and on patterns you supply.

When you launch the script, it will prompt for the Application Id
that you are giving for your detector. This is free-form ASCII with
minor restrictions. The Lua detector file will be named based on your
Application Id. If the file name already exists you will be prompted
to overwrite it.

You will also be prompted for a description of your detector to be
placed in the comments of the Lua source code. This is optional.

You will then be asked a series of questions designed to construct
Lua code based on the kind of pattern data, protocol, port(s), etc.

When complete, the Protocol menu will be changed to include the
option, "Save Detector". Instead of saving the file and exiting the
script, you are allowed to give additional criteria for another
pattern which may also be incorporated in the detection scheme. Then
either pattern, when matched, will be considered a valid detection.

For example, your first choices might create an HTTP detection
pattern of "example.com", and the next set of choices would add the
HTTP detection pattern of "example.uk.co" (an equally fictional
British counterpart). They would then co-exist in the Lua detector,
and either would cause a detection with the name you give for your
Application Id.

The resulting .lua file will need to be placed in the directory,
"custom/lua", described in the previous section of the README above
called "User Created Application Detectors"


5.3. Binder

--------------

One of the fundamental differences between Snort 2 and Snort 3
concerns configuration related to networks and ports. Here is a brief
review of Snort 2 configuration for network and service related
components:

  * Snort’s configuration has a default policy and optional policies
    selected by VLAN or network (with config binding).
  * Each policy contains a user defined set of preprocessor
    configurations.
  * Each preprocessor has a default configuration and some support
    non-default configurations selected by network.
  * Most preprocessors have port configurations.
  * The default policy may also contain a list of ports to ignore.

In Snort 3, the above configurations are done in a single module
called the binder. Here is an example:

binder =
{
    -- allow all tcp port 22:
    -- (similar to Snort 2 config ignore_ports)
    { when = { proto = 'tcp', ports = '22' }, use = { action = 'allow' } },

-- select a config file by vlan
-- (similar to Snort 2 config binding by vlan)
{ when = { vlans = '1024' }, use = { file = 'vlan.lua' } },

-- use a non-default HTTP inspector for port 8080:
-- (similar to a Snort 2 targeted preprocessor config)
{ when = { nets = '192.168.0.0/16', proto = 'tcp', ports = '8080' },
  use = { name = 'alt_http', type = 'http_inspect' } },

-- use the default inspectors:
-- (similar to a Snort 2 default preprocessor config)
{ when = { proto = 'tcp' }, use = { type = 'stream_tcp' } },
{ when = { service = 'http' }, use = { type = 'http_inspect' } },

    -- figure out which inspector to run automatically:
    { use = { type = 'wizard' } }
}

Bindings are evaluated when a session starts and again if and when
service is identified on the session. Essentially, the bindings are a
list of when-use rules evaluated from top to bottom. The first
matching network and service configurations are applied. binder.when
can contain any combination of criteria and binder.use can specify an
action, config file, or inspector configuration.

If binder is not explicitly configured (via file *.lua or option
--lua), a default binder will be instantiated in which bindings will
be created for all service inspectors configured. Some bindings may
require a configured wizard to detect the service type.


5.4. Byte rule options

--------------

5.4.1. byte_test

This rule option tests a byte field against a specific value (with
operator). Capable of testing binary values or converting
representative byte strings to their binary equivalent and testing
them.

Snort uses the C operators for each of these operators. If the &
operator is used, then it would be the same as using

if (data & value) { do_something(); }

! operator negates the results from the base check. !<oper> is
considered as

!(data <oper> value)

Note: The bitmask option applies bitwise AND operator on the bytes
converted. The result will be right-shifted by the number of bits
equal to the number of trailing zeros in the mask. This applies for
the other rule options as well.

5.4.1.1. Examples

alert tcp (byte_test:2, =, 568, 0, bitmask 0x3FF0;)

This example extracts 2 bytes at offset 0, performs bitwise and with
bitmask 0x3FF0, shifts the result by 4 bits and compares to 568.

alert udp (byte_test:4, =, 1234, 0, string, dec;
    msg:"got 1234!";)

alert udp (byte_test:8, =, 0xdeadbeef, 0, string, hex;
    msg:"got DEADBEEF!";)

5.4.2. byte_jump

The byte_jump rule option allows rules to be written for length
encoded protocols trivially. By having an option that reads the
length of a portion of data, then skips that far forward in the
packet, rules can be written that skip over specific portions of
length-encoded protocols and perform detection in very specific
locations.

5.4.2.1. Examples

alert tcp (content:"Begin";
    byte_jump:0, 0, from_end, post_offset -6;
    content:"end..", distance 0, within 5;
    msg:"Content match from end of the payload";)

alert tcp (content:"catalog";
    byte_jump:2, 1, relative, post_offset 2, bitmask 0x03f0;
    byte_test:2, =, 968, 0, relative;
    msg:"Bitmask applied on the 2 bytes extracted for byte_jump";)

5.4.3. byte_extract

The byte_extract keyword is another useful option for writing rules
against length-encoded protocols. It reads in some number of bytes
from the packet payload and saves it to a variable. These variables
can be referenced later in the rule, instead of using hard-coded
values.

5.4.3.1. Other options which use byte_extract variables

A byte_extract rule option detects nothing by itself. Its use is in
extracting packet data for use in other rule options.

Here is a list of places where byte_extract variables can be used:

  * content/uricontent: offset, depth, distance, within
  * byte_test: offset, value
  * byte_jump: offset, post_offset
  * isdataat: offset

5.4.3.2. Examples

alert tcp (byte_extract:1, 0, str_offset;
    byte_extract:1, 1, str_depth;
    content:"bad stuff", offset str_offset, depth str_depth;
    msg:"Bad Stuff detected within field";)

alert tcp (content:"START"; byte_extract:1, 0, myvar, relative;
    byte_jump:1, 3, relative, post_offset myvar;
    content:"END", distance 6, within 3;
    msg: "byte_jump - pass variable to post_offset";)

This example uses two variables.

The first variable keeps the offset of a string, read from a byte at
offset 0. The second variable keeps the depth of a string, read from
a byte at offset 1. These values are used to constrain a pattern
match to a smaller area.

alert tcp (content:"|04 63 34 35|", offset 4, depth 4;
    byte_extract: 2, 0, var_match, relative, bitmask 0x03ff;
    byte_test: 2, =, var_match, 2, relative;
    msg:"Test value match, after applying bitmask on bytes extracted";)

5.4.4. byte_math

Perform a mathematical operation on an extracted value and a
specified value or existing variable, and store the outcome in a new
resulting variable. These resulting variables can be referenced later
in the rule, at the same places as byte_extract variables.

The syntax for this rule option is different. The order of the
options is critical for the other rule options and can’t be changed.
For example, the first option is the number of bytes to extract. Here
the name of the option is explicitly written, for example : bytes 2.
The order is not important.

Note

Byte_math operations are performed on unsigned 32-bit values. When
writing a rule it should be taken into consideration to avoid wrap
around.

5.4.4.1. Examples

alert tcp ( byte_math: bytes 2, offset 0, oper *, rvalue 10, result area;
   byte_test:2,>,area,16;)

At the zero offset of the payload, extract 2 bytes and apply
multiplication operation with value 10. Store result in variable
area. The area variable is given as input to byte_test value option.

Let’s consider 2 bytes of extracted data is 5. The rvalue is 10.
Result variable area is 50 ( 5 * 10 ). Area variable can be used in
either byte_test offset/value options.

5.4.5. Testing Numerical Values

The rule options byte_test and byte_jump were written to support
writing rules for protocols that have length encoded data. RPC was
the protocol that spawned the requirement for these two rule options,
as RPC uses simple length based encoding for passing data.

In order to understand why byte test and byte jump are useful, let’s
go through an exploit attempt against the sadmind service.

This is the payload of the exploit:

Let’s break this up, describe each of the fields, and figure out how
to write a rule to catch this exploit.

There are a few things to note with RPC:

Numbers are written as uint32s, taking four bytes. The number 26
would show up as 0x0000001a.

Strings are written as a uint32 specifying the length of the string,
the string, and then null bytes to pad the length of the string to
end on a 4-byte boundary. The string bob would show up as
0x00000003626f6200.

89 09 9c e2     - the request id, a random uint32, unique to each request
00 00 00 00     - rpc type (call = 0, response = 1)
00 00 00 02     - rpc version (2)
00 01 87 88     - rpc program (0x00018788 = 100232 = sadmind)
00 00 00 0a     - rpc program version (0x0000000a = 10)
00 00 00 01     - rpc procedure (0x00000001 = 1)
00 00 00 01     - credential flavor (1 = auth_unix)
00 00 00 20     - length of auth_unix data (0x20 = 32)

## the next 32 bytes are the auth_unix data
40 28 3a 10 - unix timestamp (0x40283a10 = 1076378128 = feb 10 01:55:28 2004 gmt)
00 00 00 0a - length of the client machine name (0x0a = 10)
4d 45 54 41 53 50 4c 4f 49 54 00 00  - metasploit

00 00 00 00 - uid of requesting user (0)
00 00 00 00 - gid of requesting user (0)
00 00 00 00 - extra group ids (0)

00 00 00 00 - verifier flavor (0 = auth_null, aka none)
00 00 00 00 - length of verifier (0, aka none)

The rest of the packet is the request that gets passed to procedure 1
of sadmind.

However, we know the vulnerability is that sadmind trusts the uid
coming from the client. sadmind runs any request where the client’s
uid is 0 as root. As such, we have decoded enough of the request to
write our rule.

First, we need to make sure that our packet is an RPC call.

content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;

Then, we need to make sure that our packet is a call to sadmind.

content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;

Then, we need to make sure that our packet is a call to the procedure
1, the vulnerable procedure.

content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 4;

Then, we need to make sure that our packet has auth_unix credentials.

content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 24, depth 4;

We don’t care about the hostname, but we want to skip over it and
check a number value after the hostname. This is where byte_test is
useful. Starting at the length of the hostname, the data we have is:

00 00 00 0a 4d 45 54 41 53 50 4c 4f 49 54 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00

We want to read 4 bytes, turn it into a number, and jump that many
bytes forward, making sure to account for the padding that RPC
requires on strings. If we do that, we are now at:

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00

which happens to be the exact location of the uid, the value we want
to check.

In English, we want to read 4 bytes, 36 bytes from the beginning of
the packet, and turn those 4 bytes into an integer and jump that many
bytes forward, aligning on the 4-byte boundary. To do that in a Snort
rule, we use:

byte_jump:4,36,align;

then we want to look for the uid of 0.

content:"|00 00 00 00|", within 4;

Now that we have all the detection capabilities for our rule, let’s
put them all together.

content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;
content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;
content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 4;
content:"|00 00 00 01|", offset 24, depth 4;
byte_jump:4,36,align;
content:"|00 00 00 00|", within 4;

The 3rd and fourth string match are right next to each other, so we
should combine those patterns. We end up with:

content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;
content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;
content:"|00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 8;
byte_jump:4,36,align;
content:"|00 00 00 00|", within 4;

If the sadmind service was vulnerable to a buffer overflow when
reading the client’s hostname, instead of reading the length of the
hostname and jumping that many bytes forward, we would check the
length of the hostname to make sure it is not too large.

To do that, we would read 4 bytes, starting 36 bytes into the packet,
turn it into a number, and then make sure it is not too large (let’s
say bigger than 200 bytes). In Snort, we do:

byte_test:4,>,200,36;

Our full rule would be:

content:"|00 00 00 00|", offset 4, depth 4;
content:"|00 01 87 88|", offset 12, depth 4;
content:"|00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01|", offset 20, depth 8;
byte_test:4,>,200,36;

In case of using any byte_* option with "string" parameter, the
amount of bytes to be extracted from payload can be less than
specified by user. This might happen when the buffer has fewer bytes
(from the cursor position) than specified in the option.


5.5. Consolidated Config

--------------

Config dump mode generates a consolidated dump of the config passed
to Snort. This output consists of the configured values as well as
the module defaults for the values that aren’t configured.

In the dump mode Snort validates the config (similar to option -T)
and suppresses unrelated messages going to stdout (configuration
warnings and errors are still printed to stderr).

The dump mode is activated by the following options:
--dump-config-text, --dump-config=all, --dump-config=top. They are
described in detail below.

The simple configuration is used in examples. The output contains
applied configurations (defaults and configured). To simplify the
output we show a brief list of default options.

snort.lua

stream =
{
    max_flows = 2
}

stream_tcp =
{
    show_rebuilt_packets = true
}

binder =
{
    { when = { nets = '10.1.2.0/24' }, use = { inspection_policy = 'http.lua' } },
    { when = { nets = '192.168.2.0/24' }, use = { inspection_policy = 'sip.lua' } },
}

http.lua

wizard =
{
    spells =
    {
        { service = 'http', proto = 'tcp', to_server = { 'GET' }, to_client = { 'HTTP/' } },
    }
}

sip.lua

wizard =
{
    spells =
    {
        { service = 'sip', to_server = { 'INVITE' } },
    }
}

5.5.1. Text Format

The --dump-config-text option verifies the configuration and dumps it
to stdout in text format. The output contains a config of the main
policy and all other included sub-policies.

Example: snort -c snort.lua --dump-config-text

consolidated config for snort.lua
alerts.order="pass reset block drop alert log"
alerts.rate_filter_memcap=1048576
binder[0].when.ips_policy_id=0
binder[0].when.role="any"
binder[0].when.nets="10.1.2.0/24"
binder[0].use.action="inspect"
binder[0].use.inspection_policy="http.lua"
binder[1].when.ips_policy_id=0
binder[1].when.role="any"
binder[1].when.nets="192.168.2.0/24"
binder[1].use.action="inspect"
binder[1].use.inspection_policy="sip.lua"
output.obfuscate=false
output.wide_hex_dump=true
packets.address_space_agnostic=false
packets.limit=0
search_engine.split_any_any=true
search_engine.queue_limit=128
stream.file_cache.idle_timeout=180
stream.file_cache.cap_weight=32
stream.max_flows=2
stream_tcp.small_segments.maximum_size=0
stream_tcp.session_timeout=30
stream_tcp.track_only=false
stream_tcp.show_rebuilt_packets=true
consolidated config for http.lua
wizard.spells[0].proto="tcp"
wizard.spells[0].service="http"
wizard.spells[0].to_client[0].spell="HTTP/"
wizard.spells[0].to_server[0].spell="GET"
consolidated config for sip.lua
wizard.spells[0].proto="tcp"
wizard.spells[0].service="sip"
wizard.spells[0].to_server[0].spell="INVITE"

For lists, the index next to the option name designates an element
parsing order.

5.5.2. JSON Format

The --dump-config=all command-line option verifies the configuration
and dumps it to stdout in JSON format. The output contains a config
of the main policy and all other included sub-policies. Snort dumps
output in a one-line format.

There is 3rd party tool jq for converting to a pretty printed format.

Example: snort -c snort.lua --dump-config=all | jq .

                ]

            }
            ]
        }
        }
    }
]

The --dump-config=top command-line option is similar to --dump-config
=all, except it produces dump for the main policy only. It verifies
the configuration and dumps the main policy configuration to stdout
in JSON format.

Example: snort -c snort.lua --dump-config=top | jq .

}


5.6. DCE Inspectors

--------------

The main purpose of these inspector are to perform SMB desegmentation
and DCE/RPC defragmentation to avoid rule evasion using these
techniques.

5.6.1. Overview

The following transports are supported for DCE/RPC: SMB, TCP, and
UDP. New rule options have been implemented to improve performance,
reduce false positives and reduce the count and complexity of DCE/RPC
based rules.

Different from Snort 2, the DCE-RPC preprocessor is split into three
inspectors - one for each transport: dce_smb, dce_tcp, dce_udp. This
includes the configuration as well as the inspector modules. The
Snort 2 server configuration is now split between the inspectors.
Options that are meaningful to all inspectors, such as policy and
defragmentation, are copied into each inspector configuration. The
address/port mapping is handled by the binder. Autodetect
functionality is replaced by wizard curses.

5.6.2. Quick Guide

A typical dcerpce configuration looks like this:

binder =
{
   {
       when =
       {
           proto = 'tcp',
           ports = '139 445 1025',
        },
       use =
       {
           type = 'dce_smb',
       },
    },
    {
       when =
       {
           proto = 'tcp',
           ports = '135 2103',
       },
       use =
       {
           type = 'dce_tcp',
       },
    },
    {
       when =
       {
           proto = 'udp',
           ports = '1030',
       },
       use =
       {
           type = 'dce_udp',
       },
    }
 }

dce_smb = { }

dce_tcp = { }

dce_udp = { }

In this example, it defines smb, tcp and udp inspectors based on
port. All the configurations are default.

5.6.3. Target Based

There are enough important differences between Windows and Samba
versions that a target based approach has been implemented. Some
important differences:

  * Named pipe instance tracking
  * Accepted SMB commands
  * AndX command chaining
  * Transaction tracking
  * Multiple Bind requests
  * DCE/RPC Fragmented requests - Context ID
  * DCE/RPC Fragmented requests - Operation number
  * DCE/RPC Stub data byte order

Because of those differences, each inspector can be configured to
different policy. Here are the list of policies supported:

  * WinXP (default)
  * Win2000
  * WinVista
  * Win2003
  * Win2008
  * Win7
  * Samba
  * Samba-3.0.37
  * Samba-3.0.22
  * Samba-3.0.20

5.6.4. Reassembling

Both SMB inspector and TCP inspector support reassemble. Reassemble
threshold specifies a minimum number of bytes in the DCE/RPC
desegmentation and defragmentation buffers before creating a
reassembly packet to send to the detection engine. This option is
useful in inline mode so as to potentially catch an exploit early
before full defragmentation is done. A value of 0 s supplied as an
argument to this option will, in effect, disable this option. Default
is disabled.

5.6.5. SMB

SMB inspector is one of the most complex inspectors. In addition to
supporting rule options and lots of inspector rule events, it also
supports file processing for both SMB version 1, 2, and 3.

5.6.5.1. Finger Print Policy

In the initial phase of an SMB session, the client needs to
authenticate with a SessionSetupAndX. Both the request and response
to this command contain OS and version information that can allow the
inspector to dynamically set the policy for a session which allows
for better protection against Windows and Samba specific evasions.

5.6.5.2. File Inspection

SMB inspector supports file inspection. A typical configuration looks
like this:

binder =
{
   {
       when =
       {
           proto = 'tcp',
           ports = '139 445',
       },
       use =
       {
           type = 'dce_smb',
       },
   },
}

dce_smb =
{
    smb_file_inspection = 'on',
    smb_file_depth = 0,
 }

file_id =
{
    enable_type = true,
    enable_signature = true,
    enable_capture = true,
    file_rules = magics,
}

First, define a binder to map tcp port 139 and 445 to smb. Then,
enable file inspection in smb inspection and set the file depth as
unlimited. Lastly, enable file inspector to inspect file type,
calculate file signature, and capture file. The details of file
inspector are explained in file processing section.

SMB inspector does inspection of normal SMB file transfers. This
includes doing file type and signature through the file processing as
well as setting a pointer for the "file_data" rule option. Note that
the "file_depth" option only applies to the maximum amount of file
data for which it will set the pointer for the "file_data" rule
option. For file type and signature it will use the value configured
for the file API. If "only" is specified, the inspector will only do
SMB file inspection, i.e. it will not do any DCE/RPC tracking or
inspection. If "on" is specified with no arguments, the default file
depth is 16384 bytes. An argument of -1 to "file-depth" disables
setting the pointer for "file_data", effectively disabling SMB file
inspection in rules. An argument of 0 to "file_depth" means
unlimited. Default is "off", i.e. no SMB file inspection is done in
the inspector.

5.6.6. TCP

dce_tcp inspector supports defragmentation, reassembling, and policy
that is similar to SMB.

5.6.7. UDP

dce_udp is a very simple inspector that only supports defragmentation

5.6.8. Rule Options

New rule options are supported by enabling the dcerpc2 inspectors:

  * dce_iface
  * dce_opnum
  * dce_stub_data

New modifiers to existing byte_test and byte_jump rule options:

  * byte_test: dce
  * byte_jump: dce

5.6.8.1. dce_iface

For DCE/RPC based rules it has been necessary to set flow-bits based
on a client bind to a service to avoid false positives. It is
necessary for a client to bind to a service before being able to make
a call to it. When a client sends a bind request to the server, it
can, however, specify one or more service interfaces to bind to. Each
interface is represented by a UUID. Each interface UUID is paired
with a unique index (or context id) that future requests can use to
reference the service that the client is making a call to. The server
will respond with the interface UUIDs it accepts as valid and will
allow the client to make requests to those services. When a client
makes a request, it will specify the context id so the server knows
what service the client is making a request to. Instead of using
flow-bits, a rule can simply ask the inspector, using this rule
option, whether or not the client has bound to a specific interface
UUID and whether or not this client request is making a request to
it. This can eliminate false positives where more than one service is
bound to successfully since the inspector can correlate the bind UUID
to the context id used in the request. A DCE/RPC request can specify
whether numbers are represented as big endian or little endian. The
representation of the interface UUID is different depending on the
endianness specified in the DCE/RPC previously requiring two rules -
one for big endian and one for little endian. The inspector
eliminates the need for two rules by normalizing the UUID. An
interface contains a version. Some versions of an interface may not
be vulnerable to a certain exploit. Also, a DCE/RPC request can be
broken up into 1 or more fragments. Flags (and a field in the
connectionless header) are set in the DCE/RPC header to indicate
whether the fragment is the first, a middle or the last fragment.
Many checks for data in the DCE/RPC request are only relevant if the
DCE/RPC request is a first fragment (or full request), since
subsequent fragments will contain data deeper into the DCE/RPC
request. A rule which is looking for data, say 5 bytes into the
request (maybe it’s a length field), will be looking at the wrong
data on a fragment other than the first, since the beginning of
subsequent fragments are already offset some length from the
beginning of the request. This can be a source of false positives in
fragmented DCE/RPC traffic. By default it is reasonable to only
evaluate if the request is a first fragment (or full request).
However, if the "any_frag" option is used to specify evaluating on
all fragments.

Examples:

dce_iface: 4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188;
dce_iface: 4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188,<2;
dce_iface: 4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188,any_frag;
dce_iface: 4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188,=1,any_frag;

This option is used to specify an interface UUID. Optional arguments
are an interface version and operator to specify that the version be
less than (<), greater than (>), equal to (=) or not equal to (!) the
version specified. Also, by default the rule will only be evaluated
for a first fragment (or full request, i.e. not a fragment) since
most rules are written to start at the beginning of a request. The
"any_frag" argument says to evaluate for middle and last fragments as
well. This option requires tracking client Bind and Alter Context
requests as well as server Bind Ack and Alter Context responses for
connection-oriented DCE/RPC in the inspector. For each Bind and Alter
Context request, the client specifies a list of interface UUIDs along
with a handle (or context id) for each interface UUID that will be
used during the DCE/RPC session to reference the interface. The
server response indicates which interfaces it will allow the client
to make requests to - it either accepts or rejects the client’s wish
to bind to a certain interface. This tracking is required so that
when a request is processed, the context id used in the request can
be correlated with the interface UUID it is a handle for.

hexlong and hexshort will be specified and interpreted to be in big
endian order (this is usually the default way an interface UUID will
be seen and represented). As an example, the following Messenger
interface UUID as taken off the wire from a little endian Bind
request:

|f8 91 7b 5a 00 ff d0 11 a9 b2 00 c0 4f b6 e6 fc|

must be written as:

5a7b91f8-ff00-11d0-a9b2-00c04fb6e6fc

The same UUID taken off the wire from a big endian Bind request:

|5a 7b 91 f8 ff 00 11 d0 a9 b2 00 c0 4f b6 e6 fc|

must be written the same way:

5a7b91f8-ff00-11d0-a9b2-00c04fb6e6fc

This option matches if the specified interface UUID matches the
interface UUID (as referred to by the context id) of the DCE/RPC
request and if supplied, the version operation is true. This option
will not match if the fragment is not a first fragment (or full
request) unless the "any_frag" option is supplied in which case only
the interface UUID and version need match. Note that a defragmented
DCE/RPC request will be considered a full request.

Using this rule option will automatically insert fast pattern
contents into the fast pattern matcher. For UDP rules, the interface
UUID, in both big and little endian format will be inserted into the
fast pattern matcher. For TCP rules, (1) if the rule option
"flow:to_server|from_client" is used, |05 00 00| will be inserted
into the fast pattern matcher, (2) if the rule option
"flow:from_server|to_client" is used, |05 00 02| will be inserted
into the fast pattern matcher and (3) if the flow isn’t known, |05 00
| will be inserted into the fast pattern matcher. Note that if the
rule already has content rule options in it, the best (meaning
longest) pattern will be used. If a content in the rule uses the
fast_pattern rule option, it will unequivocally be used over the
above mentioned patterns.

5.6.8.2. dce_opnum

The opnum represents a specific function call to an interface. After
is has been determined that a client has bound to a specific
interface and is making a request to it (see above - dce_iface)
usually we want to know what function call it is making to that
service. It is likely that an exploit lies in the particular DCE/RPC
function call.

Examples:

dce_opnum: 15;
dce_opnum: 15-18;
dce_opnum: 15,18-20;
dce_opnum: 15,17,20-22;

This option is used to specify an opnum (or operation number), opnum
range or list containing either or both opnum and/or opnum-range. The
opnum of a DCE/RPC request will be matched against the opnums
specified with this option. This option matches if any one of the
opnums specified match the opnum of the DCE/RPC request.

5.6.8.3. dce_stub_data

Since most DCE/RPC based rules had to do protocol decoding only to
get to the DCE/RPC stub data, i.e. the remote procedure call or
function call data, this option will alleviate this need and place
the cursor at the beginning of the DCE/RPC stub data. This reduces
the number of rule option checks and the complexity of the rule.

This option takes no arguments.

Example:

dce_stub_data;

This option is used to place the cursor (used to walk the packet
payload in rules processing) at the beginning of the DCE/RPC stub
data, regardless of preceding rule options. There are no arguments to
this option. This option matches if there is DCE/RPC stub data.

The cursor is moved to the beginning of the stub data. All ensuing
rule options will be considered "sticky" to this buffer. The first
rule option following dce_stub_data should use absolute location
modifiers if it is position-dependent. Subsequent rule options should
use a relative modifier if they are meant to be relative to a
previous rule option match in the stub data buffer. Any rule option
that does not specify a relative modifier will be evaluated from the
start of the stub data buffer. To leave the stub data buffer and
return to the main payload buffer, use the "pkt_data" rule option.

5.6.8.4. byte_test and byte_jump

A DCE/RPC request can specify whether numbers are represented in big
or little endian. These rule options will take as a new argument
"dce" and will work basically the same as the normal byte_test/
byte_jump, but since the DCE/RPC inspector will know the endianness
of the request, it will be able to do the correct conversion.

Examples:

byte_test: 4,>,35000,0,relative,dce;
byte_test: 2,!=,2280,-10,relative,dce;

When using the "dce" argument to a byte_test, the following normal
byte_test arguments will not be allowed: "big", "little", "string",
"hex", "dec" and "oct".

Examples:

byte_jump:4,-4,relative,align,multiplier 2,post_offset -4,dce;

When using the dce argument to a byte_jump, the following normal
byte_jump arguments will not be allowed: "big", "little", "string",
"hex", "dec", "oct" and "from_beginning"


5.7. File Processing

--------------

With the volume of malware transferred through network increasing,
network file inspection becomes more and more important. This feature
will provide file type identification, file signature creation, and
file capture capabilities to help users deal with those challenges.

5.7.1. Overview

There are two parts of file services: file APIs and file policy. File
APIs provides all the file inspection functionalities, such as file
type identification, file signature calculation, and file capture.
File policy provides users ability to control file services, such as
enable/disable/configure file type identification, file signature, or
file capture.

In addition to all capabilities from Snort 2, we support customized
file policy along with file event log.

  * Supported protocols: HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, and SMB.
  * Supported file signature calculation: SHA256

5.7.2. Quick Guide

A very simple configuration has been included in lua/snort.lua file.
A typical file configuration looks like this:

dofile('magic.lua')

my_file_policy =
{
    {  when = { file_type_id = 0 }, use = { verdict = 'log', enable_file_signature = true, enable_file_capture = true } }
    {  when = { file_type_id = 22 }, use = { verdict = 'log', enable_file_signature = true } },
    {  when = { sha256 = "F74DC976BC8387E7D4FC0716A069017A0C7ED13F309A523CC41A8739CCB7D4B6" }, use = { verdict = 'block'} },
}

file_id =
{
    enable_type = true,
    enable_signature = true,
    enable_capture = true,
    file_rules = magics,
    trace_type = true,
    trace_signature = true,
    trace_stream = true,
    file_policy = my_file_policy,
 }

file_log =
{
    log_pkt_time = true,
    log_sys_time = false,
}

There are 3 steps to enable file processing:

  * First, you need to include the file magic rules.
  * Then, define the file policy and configure the inspector
  * At last, enable file_log to get detailed information about file
    event

5.7.3. Pre-packaged File Magic Rules

A set of file magic rules is packaged with Snort. They can be located
at "lua/file_magic.lua". To use this feature, it is recommended that
these pre-packaged rules are used; doing so requires that you include
the file in your Snort configuration as such (already in snort.lua):

dofile('magic.lua')

Example:

{ type = "GIF", id = 62, category = "Graphics", rev = 1,
  magic = { { content = "| 47 49 46 38 37 61 |",offset = 0 } } },

{ type = "GIF", id = 63, category = "Graphics", rev = 1,
  magic = { { content = "| 47 49 46 38 39 61 |",offset = 0 } } },

The previous two rules define GIF format, because two file magics are
different. File magics are specified by content and offset, which
look at content at particular file offset to identify the file type.
In this case, two magics look at the beginning of the file. You can
use character if it is printable or hex value in between "|".

5.7.4. File Policy

You can enabled file type, file signature, or file capture by
configuring file_id. In addition, you can enable trace to see file
stream data, file type, and file signature information.

Most importantly, you can configure a file policy that can block/
alert some file type or an individual file based on SHA. This allows
you build a file blacklist or whitelist.

Example:

file_policy =
{
    {  when = { file_type_id = 22 }, use = { verdict = 'log', enable_file_signature = true } },
    {  when = { sha256 = "F74DC976BC8387E7D4FC0716A069017A0C7ED13F309A523CC41A8739CCB7D4B6" }, use = { verdict = 'block'} },
    {  when = { file_type_id = 0 }, use = { verdict = 'log', enable_file_signature = true, enable_file_capture = true } }
}

In this example, it enables this policy:

  * For PDF files, they will be logged with signatures.
  * For the file matching this SHA, it will be blocked
  * For all file types identified, they will be logged with
    signature, and also captured onto log folder.

5.7.5. File Capture

File can be captured and stored to log folder. We use SHA as file
name instead of actual file name to avoid conflicts. You can capture
either all files, some file type, or a particular file based on SHA.

You can enable file capture through this config:

enable_capture = true,

or enable it for some file or file type in your file policy:

{  when = { file_type_id = 22 }, use = { verdict = 'log', enable_file_capture = true } },

The above rule will enable PDF file capture.

5.7.6. File Events

File inspect preprocessor also works as a dynamic output plugin for
file events. It logs basic information about file. The log file is in
the same folder as other log files with name starting with
"file.log".

Example:

file_log = { log_pkt_time = true, log_sys_time = false }

All file events will be logged in packet time, system time is not
logged.

File event example:

08/14-19:14:19.100891  10.22.75.72:33734 -> 10.22.75.36:80,
[Name: "malware.exe"] [Verdict: Block] [Type: MSEXE]
[SHA: 6F26E721FDB1AAFD29B41BCF90196DEE3A5412550615A856DAE8E3634BCE9F7A]
[Size: 1039328]


5.8. High Availability

--------------

High Availability includes the HA flow synchronization and the
SideChannel messaging subsystems.

5.8.1. HA

HighAvailability (or HA) is a Snort module that provides state
coherency between two partner snort instances. It uses SideChannel
for messaging.

There can be multiple types of HA within Snort and Snort plugins. HA
implements an extensible architecture to enable plugins to subscribe
to the base flow HA messaging. These plugins can then include their
own messages along with the flow cache HA messages.

HA produces and consumes two type of messages:

  * Update - Update flow status. Plugins may add their own data to
    the messages
  * Delete - A flow has been removed from the cache

The HA module is configured with these items:

high_availability =
{
    ports = "1",
    enable = true,
    min_age = 0,
    min_sync = 0
}

The ports item maps to the SideChannel port to use for the HA
messaging.

The enabled item controls the overall HA operation.

The items min_age and min_sync are used in the stream HA logic.
min_age is the number of milliseconds that a flow must exist in the
flow cache before sending HA messages to the partner. min_sync is the
minimum time between HA status updates. HA messages for a particular
flow will not be sent faster than min_sync. Both are expressed as a
number of milliseconds.

HA messages are composed of the base stream information plus any
content from additional modules. Modules subscribe HA in order to add
message content. The stream HA content is always present in the
messages while the ancillary module content is only present when
requested via a status change request.

5.8.2. Connector

Connectors are a set of modules that are used to exchange
message-oriented data among Snort threads and the external world. A
typical use-case is HA (High Availability) message exchange.
Connectors serve to decouple the message transport from the message
creation/consumption. Connectors expose a common API for several
forms of message transport.

Connectors are a Snort plugin type.

5.8.2.1. Connector (parent plugin class)

Connectors may either be a simplex channel and perform unidirectional
communications. Or may be duplex and perform bidirectional
communications. The TcpConnector is duplex while the FileConnector is
simplex.

All subtypes of Connector have a direction configuration element and
a connector element. The connector string is the key used to identify
the element for sidechannel configuration. The direction element may
have a default value, for instance TcpConnector’s are duplex.

There are currently two implementations of Connectors:

  * TcpConnector - Exchange messages over a tcp channel.
  * FileConnector - Write messages to files and read messages from
    files.

5.8.2.2. TcpConnector

TcpConnector is a subclass of Connector and implements a DUPLEX type
Connector, able to send and receive messages over a tcp session.

TcpConnector adds a few session setup configuration elements:

  * setup = call or answer - call is used to have TcpConnector
    initiate the connection. answer is used to have TcpConnector
    accept incoming connections.
  * address = <addr> - used for call setup to specify the partner
  * base_port = port - used to construct the actual port number for 
    call and answer modes. Actual port used is (base_port +
    instance_id).

An example segment of TcpConnector configuration:

tcp_connector =
{
    {
        connector = 'tcp_1',
        address = '127.0.0.1',
        setup = 'call',
        base_port = 11000
    },
}

5.8.2.3. FileConnector

FileConnector implements a Connector that can either read from files
or write to files. FileConnector’s are simplex and must be configured
to be CONN_TRANSMIT or CONN_RECEIVE.

FileConnector configuration adds two additional element:

  * name = string - used as part of the message file name
  * format = text or binary - FileConnector supports two file types

The configured name string is used to construct the actual names as
in:

  * file_connector_NAME_transmit and file_connector_NAME_receive

All messages for one Snort invocation are read and written to one
file.

In the case of a receive FileConnector, all messages are read from
the file prior to the start of packet processing. This allows the
messages to establish state information for all processed packets.

Connectors are used solely by SideChannel

An example segment of FileConnector configuration:

file_connector =
{
    {
        connector = 'file_tx_1',
        direction = 'transmit',
        format = 'text',
        name = 'HA'
    },
    {
        connector = 'file_rx_1',
        direction = 'receive',
        format = 'text',
        name = 'HA'
    },
}

5.8.3. Side Channel

SideChannel is a Snort module that uses Connectors to implement a
messaging infrastructure that is used to communicate between Snort
threads and the outside world.

SideChannel adds functionality onto the Connector as:

  * message multiplexing/demultiplexing - An additional protocol
    layer is added to the messages. This port number is used to
    direct message to/from various SideClass instancs.
  * application receive processing - handler for received messages on
    a specific port.

SideChannel’s are always implement a duplex (bidirectional) messaging
model and can map to separate transmit and receive Connectors.

The message handling model leverages the underlying Connector
handling. So please refer to the Connector documentation.

SideChannel’s are instantiated by various applications. The
SideChannel port numbers are the configuration element used to map
SideChannel’s to applications.

The SideChannel configuration mostly serves to map a port number to a
Connector or set of connectors. Each port mapping can have at most
one transmit plus one receive connector or one duplex connector.
Multiple SideChannel’s may be configured and instantiated to support
multiple applications.

An example SideChannel configuration along with the corresponding
Connector configuration:

side_channel =
{
    {
        ports = '1',
        connectors =
        {
            {
                connector = 'file_rx_1',
            },
            {
                connector = 'file_tx_1',
            }
        },
    },
}

file_connector =
{
    {
        connector = 'file_tx_1',
        direction = 'transmit',
        format = 'text',
        name = 'HA'
    },
    {
        connector = 'file_rx_1',
        direction = 'receive',
        format = 'text',
        name = 'HA'
    },
}


5.9. FTP

--------------

Given an FTP command channel buffer, FTP will interpret the data,
identifying FTP commands and parameters, as well as FTP response
codes and messages. It will enforce correctness of the parameters,
determine when an FTP command connection is encrypted, and determine
when an FTP data channel is opened.

5.9.1. Configuring the inspector to block exploits and attacks

5.9.1.1. ftp_server configuration

  * ftp_cmds

This specifies additional FTP commands outside of those checked by
default within the inspector. The inspector may be configured to
generate an alert when it sees a command it does not recognize.

Aside from the default commands recognized, it may be necessary to
allow the use of the "X" commands, specified in RFC 775. To do so,
use the following ftp_cmds option. Since these are rarely used by FTP
client implementations, they are not included in the defaults.

ftp_cmds = [[ XPWD XCWD XCUP XMKD XRMD ]]

  * def_max_param_len

This specifies the default maximum parameter length for all commands
in bytes. If the parameter for an FTP command exceeds that length,
and the inspector is configured to do so, an alert will be generated.
This is used to check for buffer overflow exploits within FTP
servers.

  * cmd_validity

This specifies the valid format and length for parameters of a given
command.

  * cmd_validity[].len

This specifies the maximum parameter length for the specified command
in bytes, overriding the default. If the parameter for that FTP
command exceeds that length, and the inspector is configured to do
so, an alert will be generated. It can be used to restrict specific
commands to small parameter values. For example the USER
command — usernames may be no longer than 16 bytes, so the
appropriate configuration would be:

cmd_validity =
{
    {
        command = 'USER',
        length = 16,
    }
}

  * cmd_validity[].format

format is as follows:

int                 Param must be an integer
number              Param must be an integer between 1 and 255
char <chars>        Param must be a single char, and one of <chars>
date <datefmt>      Param follows format specified where
                    # = Number, C=Char, []=optional, |=OR, {}=choice,
                    anything else=literal (i.e., .+- )
string              Param is string (effectively unrestricted)
host_port           Param must a host port specifier, per RFC 959.
long_host_port      Parameter must be a long host port specified, per RFC 1639
extended_host_port  Parameter must be an extended host port specified, per RFC 2428

Examples of the cmd_validity option are shown below. These examples
are the default checks (per RFC 959 and others) performed by the
inspector.

cmd_validity =
{
    {
        command = 'CWD',
        length = 200,
    },
    {
        command = 'MODE',
        format = '< char SBC >',
    },
    {
        command = 'STRU',
        format = '< char FRP >',
    },
    {
        command = 'ALLO',
        format = '< int [ char R int ] >',
    },
    {
        command = 'TYPE',
        format = [[ < { char AE [ char NTC ] | char I | char L [ number ]
            } > ]],
    },
    {
        command = 'PORT',
        format = '< host_port >',
    },
}

A cmd_validity entry in the configuration can be used to override
these defaults and/or add a check for other commands. A few examples
follow.

This allows additional modes, including mode Z which allows for
zip-style compression:

cmd_validity =
{
    {
        command = 'MODE',
        format = '< char ASBCZ >',
    },
}

Allow for a date in the MDTM command:

cmd_validity =
{
    {
        command = 'MDTM',
        format = '< [ date nnnnnnnnnnnnnn[.n[n[n]]] ] string >',
    },
}

MDTM is an odd case that is worth discussing…

While not part of an established standard, certain FTP servers accept
MDTM commands that set the modification time on a file. The most
common among servers that do, accept a format using YYYYMMDDHHmmss
[.uuu]. Some others accept a format using YYYYMMDDHHmmss[+|-]TZ
format. The example above is for the first case.

To check validity for a server that uses the TZ format, use the
following:

cmd_validity =
{
    {
        command = 'MDTM',
        format = '< [ date nnnnnnnnnnnnnn[{+|-}n[n]] ] string >',
    },
}

  * chk_str_fmt

This causes the inspector to check for string format attacks on the
specified commands.

  * telnet_cmds

Detect and alert when telnet cmds are seen on the FTP command
channel.

  * ignore_telnet_erase_cmds

This option allows Snort to ignore telnet escape sequences for erase
character (TNC EAC) and erase line (TNC EAL) when normalizing FTP
command channel. Some FTP servers do not process those telnet escape
sequences.

  * ignore_data_chan

When set to true, causes the FTP inspector to force the rest of snort
to ignore the FTP data channel connections. NO INSPECTION other than
state (inspector AND rules) will be performed on that data channel.
It can be turned on to improve performance — especially with respect
to large file transfers from a trusted source — by ignoring traffic.
If your rule set includes virus-type rules, it is recommended that
this option not be used.

5.9.1.2. ftp_client configuration

  * max_resp_len

This specifies the maximum length for all response messages in bytes.
If the message for an FTP response (everything after the 3 digit
code) exceeds that length, and the inspector is configured to do so,
an alert will be generated. This is used to check for buffer overflow
exploits within FTP clients.

  * telnet_cmds

Detect and alert when telnet cmds are seen on the FTP command
channel.

  * ignore_telnet_erase_cmds

This option allows Snort to ignore telnet escape sequences for erase
character (TNC EAC) and erase line (TNC EAL) when normalizing FTP
command channel. Some FTP clients do not process those telnet escape
sequences.

5.9.1.3. ftp_data

In order to enable file inspection for ftp, the following should be
added to the configuration:

ftp_data = {}


5.10. HTTP Inspector

--------------

One of the major undertakings for Snort 3 is developing a completely
new HTTP inspector.

5.10.1. Overview

You can configure it by adding:

http_inspect = {}

to your snort.lua configuration file. Or you can read about it in the
source code under src/service_inspectors/http_inspect.

So why a new HTTP inspector?

For starters it is object-oriented. That’s good for us because we
maintain this software. But it should also be really nice for
open-source developers. You can make meaningful changes and additions
to HTTP processing without having to understand the whole thing. In
fact much of the new HTTP inspector’s knowledge of HTTP is
centralized in a series of tables where it can be easily reviewed and
modified. Many significant changes can be made just by updating these
tables.

http_inspect is the first inspector written specifically for the new
Snort 3 architecture. This provides access to one of the very best
features of Snort 3: purely PDU-based inspection. The classic
preprocessor processes HTTP messages, but even while doing so it is
constantly aware of IP packets and how they divide up the TCP data
stream. The same HTTP message might be processed differently
depending on how the sender (bad guy) divided it up into IP packets.

http_inspect is free of this burden and can focus exclusively on
HTTP. This makes it much simpler, easier to test, and less prone to
false positives. It also greatly reduces the opportunity for
adversaries to probe the inspector for weak spots by adjusting packet
boundaries to disguise bad behavior.

Dealing solely with HTTP messages also opens the door for developing
major new features. The http_inspect design supports true stateful
processing. Want to ask questions that involve both the client
request and the server response? Or different requests in the same
session? These things are possible.

http_inspect is taking a very different approach to HTTP header
fields. The classic preprocessor divides all the HTTP headers
following the start line into cookies and everything else. It
normalizes the two pieces using a generic process and puts them in
buffers that one can write rules against. There is some limited
support for examining individual headers within the inspector but it
is very specific.

The new concept is that every header should be normalized in an
appropriate and specific way and individually made available for the
user to write rules against it. If for example a header is supposed
to be a date then normalization means put that date in a standard
format.

5.10.2. Legacy and Enhanced Normalizers

Currently, there are Legacy and Enhanced Normalizers for JavaScript
normalization. Both normalizers are independent and can be configured
separately. The Legacy normalizer should be considered deprecated.
The Enhanced Normalizer is encouraged to use for JavaScript
normalization in the first place as we continue improving
functionality and quality. The Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer has to
be configured as a separate module:

js_norm = {}

Refer to JavaScript Normalization section for Enhanced Normalizer
specifics.

5.10.2.1. Legacy Normalizer

The Legacy Normalizer can normalize obfuscated data within the
JavaScript functions such as unescape, String.fromCharCode,
decodeURI, and decodeURIComponent. It also replaces consecutive
whitespaces with a single space and normalizes the plus by
concatenating the strings. For more information on how to enable
Legacy Normalizer, check the http_inspect.normalize_javascript
option. Legacy Normalizer is deprecated preferably to use Enhanced
Normalizer. After supporting backward compatibility in the Enhanced
Normalizer, Legacy Normalizer will be removed.

5.10.3. Configuration

Configuration can be as simple as adding:

http_inspect = {}

to your snort.lua file. The default configuration provides a thorough
inspection and may be all that you need. But there are some options
that provide extra features, tweak how things are done, or conserve
resources by doing less.

5.10.3.1. request_depth and response_depth

These replace the flow depth parameters used by the old HTTP
inspector but they work differently.

The default is to inspect the entire HTTP message body. That’s a very
sound approach but if your HTTP traffic includes many very large
files such as videos the load on Snort can become burdensome. Setting
the request_depth and response_depth parameters will limit the amount
of body data that is sent to the rule engine. For example:

request_depth = 10000,
response_depth = 80000,

would examine only the first 10000 bytes of POST, PUT, and other
message bodies sent by the client. Responses from the server would be
limited to 80000 bytes.

These limits apply only to the message bodies. HTTP headers are
always completely inspected.

If you want to only inspect headers and no body, set the depth to 0.
If you want to inspect the entire body set the depth to -1 or simply
omit the depth parameter entirely because that is the default.

These limits have no effect on how much data is forwarded to file
processing.

5.10.3.2. allowed_methods and disallowed_methods

When either of these options are set, HTTP inspector will check if
the method in the HTTP request is allowed and if not raise alert
119:287. You can either define a list of allowed methods or a list of
disallowed methods. Defining both is a configuration error. When a
list of disallowed methods is defined, any method not present on that
list is implicitly allowed. Methods on either of these lists are
considered known methods and will not raise alert 119:31. For example
if configured for:

allowed_methods = "GET,PUT,BLUE"

HTTP inspector will raise 119:287 for POST and RED, no alert 119:31
will be raised for BLUE, and 119:31 will be raised for RED. If
configured for

disallowed_methods = "POST,RED"

HTTP inspector will raise 119:287 for POST and RED, 119:31 for BLUE,
and no alert 119:31 will be raised for RED.

5.10.3.3. script_detection

Script detection is a feature that enables Snort to more quickly
detect and block response messages containing malicious JavaScript.
When http_inspect detects the end of a script it immediately forwards
the available part of the message body for early detection. This
enables malicious Javascripts to be detected more quickly but
consumes somewhat more of the sensor’s resources.

This feature is off by default. script_detection = true will activate
it.

5.10.3.4. gzip

http_inspect by default decompresses deflate and gzip message bodies
before inspecting them. This feature can be turned off by unzip =
false. Turning off decompression provides a substantial performance
improvement but at a very high price. It is unlikely that any
meaningful inspection of message bodies will be possible. Effectively
HTTP processing would be limited to the headers.

5.10.3.5. normalize_utf

http_inspect will decode utf-8, utf-7, utf-16le, utf-16be, utf-32le,
and utf-32be in response message bodies based on the Content-Type
header. This feature is on by default: normalize_utf = false will
deactivate it.

5.10.3.6. decompress_pdf

decompress_pdf = true will enable decompression of compressed
portions of PDF files encountered in a message body. http_inspect
will examine the message body for PDF files that are then parsed to
locate PDF streams with a single /FlateDecode filter. The compressed
content is decompressed and made available through the file data rule
option.

5.10.3.7. decompress_swf

decompress_swf = true will enable decompression of compressed SWF
(Adobe Flash content) files encountered in a message body. The
available decompression modes are ’deflate’ and ’lzma’. http_inspect
will search for the file signatures CWS for Deflate/ZLIB and ZWS for
LZMA. The compressed content is decompressed and made available
through the file data rule option. The compressed SWF file signature
is converted to FWS to indicate an uncompressed file.

5.10.3.8. decompress_zip

decompress_zip = true will enable decompression of compressed zip
archives encountered in a message body. The compressed content is
decompressed and made available through the file_data rule option.

5.10.3.9. decompress_vba

decompress_vba = true will enable decompression of RLE (Run Length
Encoding) compressed vba (Visual Basic for Applications) macro data
of MS Office files encountered in a message body. The MS office files
are PKZIP compressed which are parsed to locate the OLE (Object
Linking and Embedding) file embedded with the files containing RLE
compressed vba macro data. The decompressed vba macro data is then
made available through the vba_data ips rule option.

5.10.3.10. max_mime_attach

HTTP request message bodies may be in MIME format. Each file
attachment is separately incorporated in the file_data rule option.
When a request contains many small file attachments these inspections
may consume a lot of processing power. This parameter limits the
number of files from one message that are inspected. The default
value is 5.

5.10.3.11. normalize_javascript

normalize_javascript = true will enable legacy normalizer of
JavaScript within the HTTP response body. http_inspect looks for
JavaScript by searching for the <script> tag without a type.
Obfuscated data within the JavaScript functions such as unescape,
String.fromCharCode, decodeURI, and decodeURIComponent are
normalized. The different encodings handled within the unescape,
decodeURI, or decodeURIComponent are %XX, %uXXXX, XX and uXXXXi.
http_inspect also replaces consecutive whitespaces with a single
space and normalizes the plus by concatenating the strings. Such
normalizations refer to basic JavaScript normalization.

5.10.3.12. xff_headers

This configuration supports defining custom x-forwarded-for type
headers. In a multi-vendor world, it is quite possible that the
header name carrying the original client IP could be vendor-specific.
This is due to the absence of standardization which would otherwise
standardize the header name. In such a scenario, this configuration
provides a way with which such headers can be introduced to HI. The
default value of this configuration is "x-forwarded-for
true-client-ip". The default definition introduces the two commonly
known headers and is preferred in the same order by the inspector as
they are defined, e.g "x-forwarded-for" will be preferred than
"true-client-ip" if both headers are present in the stream. The
header names should be delimited by a space.

5.10.3.13. maximum_host_length

Setting maximum_host_length causes http_inspect to generate 119:25 if
the Host header value including optional white space exceeds the
specified length. In the abnormal case of multiple Host headers, the
total length of the combined values is used. The default value is -1,
meaning do not perform this check.

5.10.3.14. maximum_chunk_length

http_inspect strictly limits individual chunks within a chunked
message body to be less than four gigabytes.

A lower limit may be configured by setting maximum_chunk_length. Any
chunk longer than maximum chunk length will generate a 119:16 alert.

5.10.3.15. maximum_header_length

http_inspect generates 119:19 when the length of a header exceeds
maximum_header_length = N {0 : 65535} (default 4096).

5.10.3.16. maximum_headers

http_inspect generates 119:20 when the number of headers exceeds
maximum_headers = N {0 : 65535} (default 200).

5.10.3.17. maximum_pipelined_requests

http_inspect generates 119:34 when the number of pipelined requests
exceeds maximum_pipelined_requests = N {0 : 99} (default 99). This
number does not include the first request in a sequence of requests.
Setting maximum_pipelined_requests = 0, will not trigger an alert in
the case of an alternating sequence of requests and responses. It
will trigger the alert once the client issue a request before getting
the response to a previous request.

5.10.3.18. URI processing

Normalization and inspection of the URI in the HTTP request message
is a key aspect of what http_inspect does. The best way to normalize
a URI is very dependent on the idiosyncrasies of the HTTP server
being accessed. The goal is to interpret the URI the same way as the
server will so that nothing the server will see can be hidden from
the rule engine.

The default URI inspection parameters are oriented toward following
the HTTP RFCs—reading the URI the way the standards say it should be
read. Most servers deviate from this ideal in various ways that can
be exploited by an attacker. The options provide tools for the user
to cope with that.

utf8 = true
plus_to_space = true
percent_u = false
utf8_bare_byte = false
iis_unicode = false
iis_double_decode = true

The HTTP inspector normalizes percent encodings found in URIs. For
instance it will convert "%48%69%64%64%65%6e" to "Hidden". All the
options listed above control how this is done. The options listed as
true are fairly standard features that are decoded by default. You
don’t need to list them in snort.lua unless you want to turn them off
by setting them to false. But that is not recommended unless you know
what you are doing and have a definite reason.

The other options are primarily for the protection of servers that
support irregular forms of decoding. These features are off by
default but you can activate them if you need to by setting them to
true in snort.lua.

bad_characters = "0x25 0x7e 0x6b 0x80 0x81 0x82 0x83 0x84"

That’s a list of 8-bit Ascii characters that you don’t want present
in any normalized URI after the percent decoding is done. For example
0x25 is a hexadecimal number (37 in decimal) which stands for the %
character. The % character is legitimately used for encoding special
characters in a URI. But if there is still a percent after
normalization one might conclude that something is wrong. If you
choose to configure 0x25 as a bad character there will be an alert
whenever this happens.

Another example is 0x00 which signifies the null character zero. Null
characters in a URI are generally wrong and very suspicious.

The default is not to alert on any of the 256 8-bit Ascii characters.
Add this option to your configuration if you want to define some bad
characters.

ignore_unreserved = "abc123"

Percent encoding common characters such as letters and numbers that
have no special meaning in HTTP is suspicious. It’s legal but why
would you do it unless you have something to hide? http_inspect will
alert whenever an upper-case or lower-case letter, a digit, period,
underscore, tilde, or minus is percent-encoded. But if a legitimate
application in your environment encodes some of these characters for
some reason this allows you to create exemptions for those
characters.

In the example, the lower-case letters a, b, and c and the digits 1,
2, and 3 are exempted. These may be percent-encoded without
generating an alert.

simplify_path = true
backslash_to_slash = true

HTTP inspector simplifies directory paths in URIs by eliminating
extra traversals using ., .., and /.

For example I can take a simple URI such as

/very/easy/example

and complicate it like this:

/very/../very/././././easy//////detour/to/nowhere/../.././../example

which may be very difficult to match with a detection rule.
simplify_path is on by default and you should not turn it off unless
you have no interest in URI paths.

backslash_to_slash is a tweak to path simplification for servers that
allow directories to be separated by backslashes:

/this/is/the/normal/way/to/write/a/path

\this\is\the\other\way\to\write\a\path

backslash_to_slash is turned on by default. It replaces all the
backslashes with slashes during normalization.

5.10.4. CONNECT processing

The HTTP CONNECT method is used by a client to establish a tunnel to
a destination via an HTTP proxy server. If the connection is
successful the server will send a 2XX success response to the client,
then proceed to blindly forward traffic between the client and
destination. That traffic belongs to a new session between the client
and destination and may be of any protocol, so clearly the HTTP
inspector will be unable to continue processing traffic following the
CONNECT message as if it were just a continuation of the original
HTTP/1.1 session.

Therefore upon receiving a success response to a CONNECT request, the
HTTP inspector will stop inspecting the session. The next packet will
return to the wizard, which will determine the appropriate inspector
to continue processing the flow. If the tunneled protocol happens to
be HTTP/1.1, the HTTP inspector will again start inspecting the flow,
but as an entirely new session.

There is one scenario where the cutover to the wizard will not occur
despite a 2XX success response to a CONNECT request. HTTP allows for
pipelining, or sending multiple requests without waiting for a
response. If the HTTP inspector sees any further traffic from the
client after a CONNECT request before it has seen the CONNECT
response, it is unclear whether this traffic should be interpreted as
a pipelined HTTP request or tunnel traffic sent in anticipation of a
success response from the server. Due to this potential evasion
tactic, the HTTP inspector will not cut over to the wizard if it sees
any early client-to-server traffic, but will continue normal HTTP
processing of the flow regardless of the eventual server response.

5.10.5. Detection rules

http_inspect parses HTTP messages into their components and makes
them available to the detection engine through rule options. Let’s
start with an example:

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"URI example";
    flow:established, to_server;
    http_uri; content:"chocolate";
    sid:1; rev:1; )

This rule looks for chocolate in the URI portion of the request
message. Specifically, the http_uri rule option is the normalized URI
with all the percent encodings removed. It will find chocolate in
both:

GET /chocolate/cake HTTP/1.1

and

GET /%63%68$6F%63%6F%6C%61%74%65/%63%61%6B%65 HTTP/1.1

It is also possible to search the unnormalized URI

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"Raw URI example";
    flow:established, to_server;
    http_raw_uri; content:"chocolate";
    sid:2; rev:1; )

will match the first message but not the second. If you want to
detect someone who is trying to hide his request for chocolate then

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"Raw URI example";
    flow:established, to_server;
    http_raw_uri; content:"%63%68$6F%63%6F%6C%61%74%65";
    sid:3; rev:1; )

will do the trick.

Let’s look at possible ways of writing a rule to match HTTP response
messages with the Content-Language header set to "da" (Danish). You
could write:

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"whole header search";
    flow:established, to_client;
    http_header; content:"Content-Language: da", nocase;
    sid:4; rev:1; )

This rule leaves much to be desired. Modern headers are often
thousands of bytes and seem to get longer every year. Searching all
of the headers consumes a lot of resources. Furthermore this rule is
easily evaded:

HTTP/1.1 ... Content-Language:  da ...

the extra space before the "da" throws the rule off. Or how about:

HTTP/1.1 ... Content-Language: xx,da ...

By adding a made up second language the attacker has once again
thwarted the match.

A better way to write this rule is:

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"individual header search";
    flow:established, to_client;
    http_header: field content-language; content:"da", nocase;
    sid:4; rev:2; )

The field option improves performance by narrowing the search to the
Content-Language field of the header. Because it uses the header
parsing abilities of http_inspect to find the field of interest it
will not be thrown off by extra spaces or other languages in the
list.

In addition to the headers there are rule options for virtually every
part of the HTTP message.

Occasionally one needs a rule that looks for the count of some
variable. For example, to alert when a message has more than 100
headers use this rule:

alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"more that 100 headers";
http_num_headers: > 100; sid:25; rev:1; )

This is a range-based rule. It is matching when the expression in the
rule option is true. The general format is "option operator value".
To compare for equality, use operator "=". This is the default
operator and may be omitted. Both rules below will alert when the
message has 100 headers:

alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"100 headers";
http_num_headers: = 100; sid:26; rev:1; )

alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"100 headers";
http_num_headers: 100; sid:27; rev:1; )

Compare for non-equality using operator "!" or "!=", compare for less
than using operator "<", compare for greater than using operator ">",
compare for less or equal using operator "⇐", and compare for greater
or equal using operator ">=".

To alert when a message has strictly more than 100 headers and
strictly less than 200 headers use this rule:

alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"between (100,200) headers";
http_num_headers: 100<>200; sid:28; rev:1; )

This is a range-based rule with an interval. The general format is
"option value1 operator value2". Use operator "<>" to match if the
option is in the interval excluding the endpoints, or operator "<⇒"
to include the endpoints. This rule will alert when a message has 100
headers or more and 200 headers or less:

alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg:"between [100,200] headers";
http_num_headers: 100<=>200; sid:95; rev:1; )

5.10.5.1. http_uri and http_raw_uri

These provide the URI of the request message. The raw form is exactly
as it appeared in the message and the normalized form is determined
by the URI normalization options you selected. In addition to
searching the entire URI there are six components that can be
searched individually:

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"URI path";
    flow:established, to_server;
    http_uri: path; content:"chocolate";
    sid:1; rev:2; )

By specifying "path" the search is limited to the path portion of the
URI. Informally this is the part consisting of the directory path and
file name. Thus it will match:

GET /chocolate/cake HTTP/1.1

but not:

GET /book/recipes?chocolate+cake HTTP/1.1

The question mark ends the path and begins the query portion of the
URI. Informally the query is where parameter values are set and often
contains a search to be performed.

The six components are:

 1. path: directory and file
 2. query: user parameters
 3. fragment: part of the file requested, normally found only inside
    a browser and not transmitted over the network
 4. host: domain name of the server being addressed
 5. port: TCP port number being addressed
 6. scheme: normally "http" or "https" but others are possible such
    as "ftp"

Here is an example with all six:

GET https://www.samplehost.com:287/basic/example/of/path?with-query
#and-fragment HTTP/1.1\r\n

The URI is everything between the first space and the last space.
"https" is the scheme, "www.samplehost.com" is the host, "287" is the
port, "/basic/example/of/path" is the path, "with-query" is the
query, and "and-fragment" is the fragment.

http_uri represents the normalized uri, normalization of components
depends on uri type. If the uri is of type absolute (contains all six
components) or absolute path (contains path, query and fragment) then
the path and query components are normalized. In these cases,
http_uri represents the normalized path, query, and fragment (/path?
query#fragment). If the uri is of type authority (host and port), the
host is normalized and http_uri represents the normalized host with
the port number. In all other cases http_uri is the same as
http_raw_uri.

Note: this section uses informal language to explain some things.
Nothing here is intended to conflict with the technical language of
the HTTP RFCs and the implementation follows the RFCs.

5.10.5.2. http_header and http_raw_header

These cover all the header lines except the first one. You may
specify an individual header by name using the field option as shown
in this earlier example:

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"individual header search";
    flow:established, to_client;
    http_header: field content-language; content:"da", nocase;
    sid:4; rev:2; )

This rule searches the value of the Content-Language header. Header
names are not case sensitive and may be written in the rule in any
mixture of upper and lower case.

With http_header the individual header value is normalized in a way
that is appropriate for that header.

If you don’t specify a header you get all of the headers.
http_raw_header includes the unmodified header names and values as
they appeared in the original message. http_header is the same except
percent encodings and cookies are removed and paths are simplified
exactly as if the headers were a URI.

In most cases specifying individual headers creates a more efficient
and accurate rule. It is recommended that new rules be written using
individual headers whenever possible.

5.10.5.3. http_trailer and http_raw_trailer

HTTP permits header lines to appear after a chunked body ends.
Typically they contain information about the message content that was
not available when the headers were created. For convenience we call
them trailers.

http_trailer and http_raw_trailer are identical to their header
counterparts except they apply to these end headers. If you want a
rule to inspect both kinds of headers you need to write two rules,
one using header and one using trailer.

5.10.5.4. http_cookie and http_raw_cookie

These provide the value of the Cookie header for a request message
and the Set-Cookie for a response message. If multiple cookies are
present they will be concatenated into a comma-separated list.

Normalization for http_cookie is the same URI-style normalization
applied to http_header when no specific header is specified.

5.10.5.5. http_true_ip

This provides the original IP address of the client sending the
request as it was stored by a proxy in the request message headers.
Specifically it is the last IP address listed in the X-Forwarded-For,
True-Client-IP or any other custom x-forwarded-for type header. If
multiple headers are present the preference defined in xff_headers
configuration is considered.

5.10.5.6. http_client_body

This is the body of a request message such as POST or PUT.
Normalization for http_client_body is the same URI-like normalization
applied to http_header when no specific header is specified.

5.10.5.7. http_raw_body

This is the body of a request or response message. It will be
dechunked and unzipped if applicable but will not be normalized in
any other way.

5.10.5.8. http_method

The method field of a request message. Common values are "GET",
"POST", "OPTIONS", "HEAD", "DELETE", "PUT", "TRACE", and "CONNECT".

5.10.5.9. http_stat_code

The status code field of a response message. This is normally a
3-digit number between 100 and 599. In this example it is 200.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

5.10.5.10. http_stat_msg

The reason phrase field of a response message. This is the
human-readable text following the status code. "OK" in the previous
example.

5.10.5.11. http_version

The protocol version information that appears on the first line of an
HTTP message. This is usually "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".

5.10.5.12. http_raw_request and http_raw_status

These are the unmodified first header line of the HTTP request and
response messages respectively. These rule options are a safety valve
in case you need to do something you cannot otherwise do. In most
cases it is better to use a rule option for a specific part of the
first header line. For a request message those are http_method,
http_raw_uri, and http_version. For a response message those are
http_version, http_stat_code, and http_stat_msg.

5.10.5.13. file_data

The file_data contains the normalized message body. This is the
normalization described above under gzip, normalize_utf,
decompress_pdf, decompress_swf, and normalize_javascript.

5.10.5.14. js_data

The js_data contains normalized JavaScript text collected from the
whole PDU (inline or external scripts). It requires the Enhanced
Normalizer enabled: js_norm = { }, Despite what js_data has,
file_data still contains the whole HTTP body with an original
JavaScript in it.

5.10.5.15. vba_data

The vba_data will contain the decompressed Visual Basic for
Applications (vba) macro data embedded in MS office files. It
requires decompress_zip and decompress_vba options enabled.

5.10.5.16. http_num_headers and http_num_trailers

These are range-based rule options used to check the number of
headers and trailers, respectively.

5.10.5.17. http_max_header_line and http_max_trailer_line

These are range-based rule options used to check the longest line in
request and response headers and trailers, respectively.

5.10.5.18. http_num_cookies

This is a range-based rule option that checks the number of cookies.
In a request all the individual cookies found in Cookie header are
counted. For example, in this request there are 2 cookies:

GET /send/in/some/cookies HTTP/1.1
Host: www.cookie-store.com
Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

In a response Set-Cookie headers are counted. For example, in this
response there are 2 cookies:

HTTP/1.0 540 Too much sugar
Content-Length: 5
Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; Path=/; Domain=example.com
Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly

5.10.5.19. http_version_match

Rule option that matches HTTP version to one of the listed version
values. Possible match values: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 0.9, other, and
malformed. When receiving a request line or status line, if the
version is present it will be used for comparison. If the version
doesn’t have a format of [0-9].[0-9] it is considered malformed. A
[0-9].[0-9] that is not 1.0 or 1.1 is considered other. 0.9 refers to
the original HTTP protocol version that uses simple GET requests
without headers and includes no version number. 2.0 refers to the
actual HTTP/2 protocol with framed data. Messages that follow the
general HTTP/1 format but contain version fields falsely claiming to
be HTTP/2.0 or HTTP/0.9 will match "other" as described above. The
http_version rule option is available to examine the actual bytes in
the version field.

5.10.5.20. http_header_test and http_trailer_test

Rule options that perform various tests against a specific header and
trailer field, respectively. It can perform a range test, check
whether the value is numeric or whether it is absent. Negative values
are considered non-numeric. Values with more than 18 digits are
considered non-numeric.

5.10.6. Timing issues and combining rule options

HTTP inspector is stateful. That means it is aware of a bigger
picture than the packet in front of it. It knows what all the pieces
of a message are, the dividing lines between one message and the
next, which request message triggered which response message,
pipelines, and how many messages have been sent over the current
connection.

It is possible to write rules that examine both the client request
and the server response to it.

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"request and response example";
    flow:established, to_client;
    http_uri; content:"chocolate";
    file_data; content:"white chocolate";
    sid:7; rev:1; )

This rule looks for white chocolate in a response message body where
the URI of the request contained chocolate. Note that this is a
"to_client" rule that will alert on and potentially block a server
response containing white chocolate, but only if the client URI
requested chocolate. If the rule were rewritten "to_server" it would
be nonsense and not work. Snort cannot block a client request based
on what the server response will be because that has not happened
yet.

Response messages do not have a URI so there was only one thing
http_uri could have meant in the previous rule. It had to be
referring to the request message. Sometimes that is not so clear.

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"header ambiguity example 1";
    flow:established, to_client;
    http_header; content:"chocolate";
    file_data; content:"white chocolate";
    sid:8; rev:1; )

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"header ambiguity example 2";
    flow:established, to_client;
    http_header: request; content:"chocolate";
    file_data; content:"white chocolate";
    sid:8; rev:2; )

Our search for chocolate has moved from the URI to the message
headers. Both the request and response messages have headers—which
one are we asking about? Ambiguity is always resolved in favor of
looking in the current message which is the response. The first rule
is looking for a server response containing chocolate in the headers
and white chocolate in the body.

The second rule uses the "request" option to explicitly say that the
http_header to be searched is the request header.

Fast patterns are always searched in the current message. Rule
options using "request" option can’t be used as fast patterns.

Message body sections can only go through detection at the time they
are received. Headers may be combined with later items but the body
cannot.

The sub-options "with_header", "with_body" and "with_trailer" are
deprecated, and no longer required when mixing the different
sections.


5.11. HTTP/2 Inspector

--------------

New in Snort 3, the HTTP/2 inspector enables Snort to process HTTP/2
traffic.

5.11.1. Overview

Despite the name, it is better to think of HTTP/2 not as a newer
version of HTTP/1.1, but rather a separate protocol layer that runs
under HTTP/1.1 and on top of TLS or TCP. It supports several new
features with the goal of improving the performance of HTTP requests,
notably the ability to multiplex many requests over a single TCP
connection, HTTP header compression, and server push.

HTTP/2 is a perfect fit for the new Snort 3 PDU-based inspection
architecture. The HTTP/2 inspector parses and strips the HTTP/2
protocol framing and outputs HTTP/1.1 messages, exactly what
http_inspect wants to input. The HTTP/2 traffic then undergoes the
same processing as regular HTTP/1.1 traffic discussed above. So if
you haven’t already, take a look at the HTTP Inspector section; those
features also apply to HTTP/2 traffic.

5.11.2. Configuration

You can configure the HTTP/2 inspector with the default configuration
by adding:

http2_inspect = {}

to your snort.lua configuration file. Since processing HTTP/2 traffic
relies on the HTTP inspector, http_inspect must also be configured.
Keep in mind that the http_inspect configuration will also impact
HTTP/2 traffic.

5.11.2.1. concurrent_streams_limit

This limits the maximum number of HTTP/2 streams Snort will process
concurrently in a single HTTP/2 flow. The default and minimum
configurable value is 100. It can be configured up to a maximum of
1000.

5.11.3. Detection rules

Since HTTP/2 traffic is processed through the HTTP inspector, all of
the rule options discussed above are also available for HTTP/2
traffic. To smooth the transition to inspecting HTTP/2, rules that
specify service:http will be treated as if they also specify
service:http2. Thus:

alert tcp any any -> any any (flow:established, to_server;
http_uri; content:"/foo";
service: http; sid:10; rev:1;)

is understood to mean:

alert tcp any any -> any any (flow:established, to_server;
http_uri; content:"/foo";
service: http,http2; sid:10; rev:1;)

Thus it will alert on "/foo" in the URI for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2
traffic.

The reverse is not true. "service: http2" without http will match on
HTTP/2 flows but not HTTP/1 flows.

This feature makes it easy to add HTTP/2 inspection without modifying
large numbers of existing rules. New rules should explicitly specify
"service http,http2;" if that is the desired behavior. Eventually
support for http implies http2 may be deprecated and removed.


5.12. IEC104 Inspector

--------------

iec104 inspector is a service inspector for the IEC 60870-5-104
protocol.

5.12.1. Overview

IEC 60870-5-104 (iec104) is a protocol distributed by the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) that provides a
standardized method of sending telecontrol messages between central
stations and outstations, typically running on TCP port 2404.

It is used in combination with the companion specifications in the
IEC 60870-5 family, most notably IEC 60870-5-101, to provide reliable
transport via TCP/IP.

An iec104 Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) consists of one of
three Application Protocol Control Information (APCI) structures,
each beginning with the start byte 0x68. In the case of an
Information Transfer APCI, an Application Service Data Unit (ASDU)
follows the APCI.

The iec104 inspector decodes the iec104 protocol and provides rule
options to access certain protocol fields and data content. This
allows the user to write rules for iec104 packets without decoding
the protocol.

5.12.2. Configuration

iec104 messages can be normalized to either combine a message spread
across multiple frames, or to split apart multiple messages within
one frame. No manual configuration is necessary to leverage this
functionality.

5.12.3. Quick Guide

A typical iec104 configuration looks like this:

binder =
{
    {
        when =
        {
            proto = 'tcp',
            ports = '2404'
        },
        use =
        {
            type = 'iec104'
        },
    },
}

iec104 = { }

In this example, the tcp inspector is defined based on port. All
configurations are default.

Debug logging can be enabled with the following additional
configuration:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        iec104 =
        {
            all = 1
        }
    }
}

5.12.4. Rule Options

New rule options are supported by enabling the iec104 inspector:

  * iec104_apci_type
  * iec104_asdu_func

5.12.4.1. iec104_apci_type

Determining the APCI type of an iec104 message involves checking the
state of one to two bits in the message’s first control field octet.
This can be completed with a byte_test in a plaintext rule, however
it adds unnecessary complexity to the rule. Since most rules
inspecting iec104 traffic will target APCI Type I messages, this
option was created to alleviate the need to manually check the type
and subsequently reduce the complexity of the rule.

This option takes one argument with three acceptable configurations.

Examples:

iec104_apci_type:unnumbered_control_function;
iec104_apci_type:S;
iec104_apci_type:i;

This option is used to verify that the message being processed is of
the specified type. The argument passed to this rule option can be
specified in one of three ways: the full type name, the lowercase
type abbreviation, or the uppercase type abbreviation.

5.12.4.2. iec104_asdu_func

Determining the ASDU function of an iec104 message can be completed
with a plaintext rule that checks a single byte in the message,
however it also requires verifying that the message’s APCI is of Type
I. Since a rule writer may not necessarily know that this additional
check must be made, this option was created to simplify the process
of verifying the function type and subsequently reduce the complexity
of the rule.

This option takes one argument with two acceptable configurations.

Examples:

iec104_asdu_func:M_SP_NA_1;
iec104_asdu_func:m_ps_na_1;

This option is used to verify that the message being processed is
using the specified ASDU function. The argument passed to this rule
option can be specified in one of two ways: the uppercase function
name, or the lowercase function name.


5.13. JavaScript Normalization

--------------

One of the improvements in Snort 3 is Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer
which has its own module and can be used with any service inspectors
where JavaScript code might occur. Currently it is supported for the
following inspectors: HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP.

5.13.1. Overview

You can configure it by adding:

js_norm = {}

to your snort.lua configuration file. Or you can read about it in the
source code under src/js_norm.

Having js_norm module configured and ips option js_data in the rules
automatically enables Enhanced Normalizer.

The Enhanced Normalizer can normalize JavaScript embedded in HTML
(inline scripts), in separate .js files (external scripts), and
JavaScript embedded in PDF files sent over HTTP/1, HTTP/2, SMTP, IMAP
and POP3 protocols. It supports scripts over multiple PDUs. It is a
stateful JavaScript whitespace and identifiers normalizer. Normalizer
concatenates string literals whenever it’s possible to do. This also
works with any other normalizations that result in string literals.
All JavaScript identifier names, except those from the ignore lists,
will be substituted with unified names in the following format:
var_0000 → var_ffff. The Normalizer tries to expand escaped text, so
it will appear in a readable form in the output. When such text is a
parameter of an unescape function, the entire function call will be
replaced by the unescaped string. Moreover, Normalizer validates the
syntax concerning ECMA-262 Standard, including scope tracking and
restrictions for script elements. JavaScript, embedded in PDF files,
has to be decompressed before normalization. For that, decompress_pdf
= true option has to be set in configuration of appropriate service
inspectors.

Check with the following options for more configurations:
bytes_depth, identifier_depth, max_tmpl_nest, max_bracket_depth,
max_scope_depth, ident_ignore, prop_ignore.

Enhanced normalizer is the preferred option for writing new
JavaScript related rules, though legacy normalizer (part of
http_inspect) is still available to support old rules.

5.13.2. Configuration

Configuration can be as simple as adding:

js_norm = {}

to your snort.lua file. The default configuration provides a thorough
normalization and may be all that you need, but there are some
options that provide extra features, tweak how things are done, or
conserve resources by doing less.

Also, there are default lists of ignored identifiers and object
properties provided. To get a complete default configuration, use 
default_js_norm from $SNORT_LUA_PATH/snort_defaults.lua by adding:

js_norm = default_js_norm

to your snort.lua file.

Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer implements JIT approach. Actual
normalization takes place only when js_data option is evaluated. This
option is also used as a buffer selector for normalized JavaScript
data.

5.13.2.1. bytes_depth

bytes_depth = N {-1 : max53} will set a number of input JavaScript
bytes to normalize. When the depth is reached, normalization will be
stopped. It’s implemented per-script. By default bytes_depth = -1,
will set unlimited depth.

5.13.2.2. identifier_depth

identifier_depth = N {0 : 65536} will set a number of unique
JavaScript identifiers to normalize. When the depth is reached, a
built-in alert is generated. Every response has its own identifier
substitution context, which means that identifier will retain same
normal form in multiple scripts, if they are a part of the same
response, and that this limit is set for a single response and not a
single script. By default, the value is set to 65536, which is the
max allowed number of unique identifiers. The generated names are in
the range from var_0000 to var_ffff.

5.13.2.3. max_tmpl_nest

max_tmpl_nest = N {0 : 255} (default 32) is an option of the enhanced
JavaScript normalizer that determines the deepest level of nested
template literals to be processed. Introduced in ES6, template
literals provide syntax to define a literal multiline string, which
can have arbitrary JavaScript substitutions, that will be evaluated
and inserted into the string. Such substitutions can be nested, and
require keeping track of every layer for proper normalization. This
option is present to limit the amount of memory dedicated to template
nesting tracking.

5.13.2.4. max_bracket_depth

max_bracket_depth = N {1 : 65535} (default 256) is an option of the
enhanced JavaScript normalizer that determines the maximum depth of
nesting brackets, i.e. parentheses, braces and square brackets,
nested within a matching pair, in any combination. This option is
present to limit the amount of memory dedicated to bracket tracking.

5.13.2.5. max_scope_depth

max_scope_depth = N {1 : 65535} (default 256) is an option of the
enhanced JavaScript normalizer that determines the deepest level of
nested variable scope, i.e. functions, code blocks, etc. including
the global scope. This option is present to limit the amount of
memory dedicated to scope tracking.

5.13.2.6. ident_ignore

ident_ignore = {<list of ignored identifiers>} is an option of the
enhanced JavaScript normalizer that defines a list of identifiers to
keep intact.

Identifiers in this list will not be put into normal form (var_0000).
Subsequent accessors, after dot, in square brackets or after function
call, will not be normalized as well.

For example:

console.log("bar")
document.getElementById("id").text
eval("script")
console["log"]

Every entry has to be a simple identifier, i.e. not include dots,
brackets, etc. For example:

js_norm.ident_ignore = { 'console', 'document', 'eval', 'foo' }

When a variable assignment that aliases an identifier from the list
is found, the assignment will be tracked, and subsequent occurrences
of the variable will be replaced with the stored value. This
substitution will follow JavaScript variable scope limits.

For example:

var a = console.log
a("hello") // will be substituted to 'console.log("hello")'

For class names and constructors in the list, when the class is used
with the keyword new, created object will be tracked, and its
properties will be kept intact. Identifier of the object itself,
however, will be brought to unified form.

For example:

var o = new Array() // normalized to 'var var_0000=new Array()'
o.push(10) // normalized to 'var_0000.push(10)'

The default list of ignore-identifiers is present in
"snort_defaults.lua".

Unescape function names should remain intact in the output. They
ought to be included in the ignore list. If for some reason the user
wants to disable unescape related features, then removing function’s
name from the ignore list does the trick.

5.13.2.7. prop_ignore

prop_ignore = {<list of ignored properties>} is an option of the
enhanced JavaScript normalizer that defines a list of object
properties and methods that will be kept intact during normalization
of identifiers. This list should include methods and properties of
objects that will not be tracked by assignment substitution
functionality, for example, those that can be created implicitly.

Subsequent accessors, after dot, in square brackets or after function
call, will not be normalized as well.

For example:

js_norm.prop_ignore = { 'split' }

in: "string".toUpperCase().split("").reverse().join("");
out: "string".var_0000().split("").reverse().join("");

The default list of ignored properties is present in
"snort_defaults.lua".

5.13.3. Detection rules

Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer follows JIT approach, which requires
rules with js_data IPS option to be executed. This can lead to missed
data when js_data option is not evaluated for some packets, e.g. if
there is a non-js_data fast pattern. In this case, when fast pattern
doesn’t match, JavaScript normalization is skipped for the current
PDU. If later js_data IPS rule matches again, a missed normalization
context is detected and 154:8 built-in alert is raised. Further
normalization is not possible for the script. For example:

alert http (msg:"JS in HTTP"; js_data; content:"var var_0000"; sid:1;)
alert smtp (msg:"JS in SMTP"; js_data; content:"var var_0000"; sid:2;)

5.13.3.1. js_data

The js_data IPS contains normalized JavaScript text collected from
the whole PDU. It requires the Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer
configured.

5.13.4. Trace messages

When a user needs help to sort out things going on inside Enhanced
JavaScript Normalizer, Trace module becomes handy.

$ snort --help-module trace | grep js_norm

Messages for the enhanced JavaScript Normalizer follow (more
verbosity available in debug build):

5.13.4.1. trace.module.js_norm.proc

Messages from script processing flow and their verbosity levels:

 1. Script opening tag location.
 2. Attributes of the detected script.
 3. Return codes from Normalizer.

5.13.4.2. trace.module.js_norm.dump

JavaScript data dump and verbosity levels:

 1. js_data buffer as it is passed to detection.
 2. (no messages available currently)
 3. Current script as it is passed to Normalizer.


5.14. MMS Inspector

--------------

MMS inspector is a service inspector for the MMS protocol within the
IEC 61850 specification.

5.14.1. Overview

IEC 61850 is a family of protocols, including MMS, distributed by the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) that provide a
standardized method of sending service messages between various
manufacturing and process control devices, typically running on TCP
port 102.

It is used in combination with various parts of the OSI model, most
notably the TPKT, COTP, Session, Presentation, and ACSE layers, to
provide reliable transport via TCP/IP.

The MMS inspector decodes the OSI layers encapsulating the MMS
protocol and provides rule writers access to certain protocol fields
and data content through rule options. This allows the user to write
rules for MMS messages without decoding the protocol.

5.14.2. Configuration

MMS messages can be sent in a variety of ways including multiple PDUs
within one TCP packet, one PDU split across multiple TCP packets, or
a combination of the two. It is the aim of the MMS service inspector
to normalize the traffic such that only complete MMS messages are
presented to the user. No manual configuration other than enabling
the MMS service inspector is necessary to leverage this
functionality.

5.14.3. Quick Guide

A typical MMS configuration looks like this:

wizard = { curses = {'mms'}, }
mms = { }

binder =
{
    { when = { service = 'mms' }, use = { type = 'mms' } },
    { use = { type = 'wizard' } }
}

In this example, the mms inspector is defined based on patterns known
to be consistent with MMS messages.

5.14.4. Rule Options

New rule options are supported by enabling the MMS inspector:

  * mms_data
  * mms_func

5.14.4.1. mms_data

mms_data moves the cursor to the start of the MMS message, bypassing
all of the OSI encapsulation layers and allowing subsequent rule
options to start processing from the MMS PDU field.

This option takes no arguments.

In the following example, the rule is using the mms_data rule option
to set the cursor position to the beginning of the MMS PDU, and then
checking the byte at that position for the value indicative of an
Initiate-Request message.

alert tcp ( \
  msg: "PROTOCOL-SCADA MMS Initiate-Request"; \
  flow: to_server, established; \
  mms_data; \
  content:"|A8|", depth 1; \
  sid:1000000; \
)

5.14.4.2. mms_func

mms_func takes the supplied function name or number and compares it
with the Confirmed Service Request/Response in the message being
analyzed.

This option takes one argument.

In the following example the rule is using the mms_func rule option
with a string argument containing the Confirmed Service Request
service name on which to alert. This is combined with a content match
for a Confirmed Service Request message (0xA0) to allow for use of
the fast pattern matcher.

alert tcp ( \
  msg: "PROTOCOL-SCADA MMS svc get_name_list"; \
  flow: to_server, established; \
  content:"|A0|"; \
  mms_func: get_name_list; \
  sid:1000000; \
)

The following example also uses the mms_func rule option to alert on
a GetNameList message, but this time an integer argument containing
the function number is used.

alert tcp ( \
  msg: "PROTOCOL-SCADA MMS svc get_name_list"; \
  flow: to_server, established; \
  content:"|A0|"; \
  mms_func:1; \
  sid:1000001; \
)


5.15. Performance Monitor

--------------

The new and improved performance monitor! Is your sensor being bogged
down by too many flows? perf_monitor! Why are certain TCP segments
being dropped without hitting a rule? perf_monitor! Why is a sensor
leaking water? Not perf_monitor, check with stream…

5.15.1. Overview

The Snort performance monitor is the built-in utility for monitoring
system and traffic statistics. All statistics are separated by
processing thread. perf_monitor supports several trackers for
monitoring such data:

5.15.2. Base Tracker

The base tracker is used to gather running statistics about Snort and
its running modules. All Snort modules gather, at the very least,
counters for the number of packets reaching it. Most supplement these
counts with those for domain specific functions, such as
http_inspect’s number of GET requests seen.

Statistics are gathered live and can be reported at regular
intervals. The stats reported correspond only to the interval in
question and are reset at the beginning of each interval.

These are the same counts displayed when Snort shuts down, only
sorted amongst the discrete intervals in which they occurred.

Base differs from prior implementations in Snort in that all stats
gathered are only raw counts, allowing the data to be evaluated as
needed. Additionally, base is entirely pluggable. Data from new Snort
plugins can be added to the existing stats either automatically or,
if specified, by name and function.

All plugins and counters can be enabled or disabled individually,
allowing for only the data that is actually desired instead of overly
verbose performance logs.

To enable everything:

perf_monitor = { modules = {} }

To enable everything within a module:

perf_monitor =
{
    modules =
    {
        {
            name = 'stream_tcp',
            pegs = [[ ]]
        },
    }
}

To enable specific counts within modules:

perf_monitor =
{
    modules =
    {
        {
            name = 'stream_tcp',
            pegs = [[ overlaps gaps ]]
        },
    }

Note: Event stats from prior Snorts are now located within base
statistics.

5.15.3. Flow Tracker

Flow tracks statistics regarding traffic and L3/L4 protocol
distributions. This data can be used to build a profile of traffic
for inspector tuning and for identifying where Snort may be stressed.

To enable:

perf_monitor = { flow = true }

5.15.4. FlowIP Tracker

FlowIP provides statistics for individual hosts within a network.
This data can be used for identifying communication habits, such as
generating large or small amounts of data, opening a small or large
number of sessions, and tendency to send smaller or larger IP
packets.

To enable:

perf_monitor = { flow_ip = true }

5.15.5. CPU Tracker

This tracker monitors the CPU and wall time spent by a given
processing thread.

To enable:

perf_monitor = { cpu = true }

5.15.6. Formatters

Performance monitor allows statistics to be output in a few formats.
Along with human readable text (as seen at shutdown) and csv formats,
a JSON format format is also available.


5.16. POP and IMAP

--------------

POP inspector is a service inspector for POP3 protocol and IMAP
inspector is for IMAP4 protocol.

5.16.1. Overview

POP and IMAP inspectors examine data traffic and find POP and IMAP
commands and responses. The inspectors also identify the command,
header, body sections and extract the MIME attachments and decode it
appropriately. The pop and imap also identify and whitelist the pop
and imap traffic.

5.16.2. Configuration

POP inspector and IMAP inspector offer same set of configuration
options for MIME decoding depth. These depths range from 0 to 65535
bytes. Setting the value to 0 ("do none") turns the feature off.
Alternatively the value -1 means an unlimited amount of data should
be decoded. If you do not specify the default value is -1
(unlimited).

The depth limits apply per attachment. They are:

5.16.2.1. b64_decode_depth

Set the base64 decoding depth used to decode the base64-encoded MIME
attachments.

5.16.2.2. qp_decode_depth

Set the Quoted-Printable (QP) decoding depth used to decode
QP-encoded MIME attachments.

5.16.2.3. bitenc_decode_depth

Set the non-encoded MIME extraction depth used for non-encoded MIME
attachments.

5.16.2.4. uu_decode_depth

Set the Unix-to-Unix (UU) decoding depth used to decode UU-encoded
attachments.

5.16.2.5. Examples

stream = { }

stream_tcp = { }

stream_ip = { }

binder =
{

5.17. Port Scan

--------------

A module to detect port scanning

5.17.1. Overview

This module is designed to detect the first phase in a network
attack: Reconnaissance. In the Reconnaissance phase, an attacker
determines what types of network protocols or services a host
supports. This is the traditional place where a portscan takes place.
This phase assumes the attacking host has no prior knowledge of what
protocols or services are supported by the target, otherwise this
phase would not be necessary.

As the attacker has no beforehand knowledge of its intended target,
most queries sent by the attacker will be negative (meaning that the
services are closed). In the nature of legitimate network
communications, negative responses from hosts are rare, and rarer
still are multiple negative responses within a given amount of time.
Our primary objective in detecting portscans is to detect and track
these negative responses.

One of the most common portscanning tools in use today is Nmap. Nmap
encompasses many, if not all, of the current portscanning techniques.
Portscan was designed to be able to detect the different types of
scans Nmap can produce.

The following are a list of the types of Nmap scans Portscan will
currently alert for.

  * TCP Portscan
  * UDP Portscan
  * IP Portscan

These alerts are for one to one portscans, which are the traditional
types of scans; one host scans multiple ports on another host. Most
of the port queries will be negative, since most hosts have
relatively few services available.

  * TCP Decoy Portscan
  * UDP Decoy Portscan
  * IP Decoy Portscan

Decoy portscans are much like regular, only the attacker has spoofed
source address inter-mixed with the real scanning address. This
tactic helps hide the true identity of the attacker.

  * TCP Distributed Portscan
  * UDP Distributed Portscan
  * IP Distributed Portscan

These are many to one portscans. Distributed portscans occur when
multiple hosts query one host for open services. This is used to
evade an IDS and obfuscate command and control hosts.

Note

Negative queries will be distributed among scanning hosts, so we
track this type of scan through the scanned host.

  * TCP Portsweep
  * UDP Portsweep
  * IP Portsweep
  * ICMP Portsweep

These alerts are for one to many portsweeps. One host scans a single
port on multiple hosts. This usually occurs when a new exploit comes
out and the attacker is looking for a specific service.

Note

The characteristics of a portsweep scan may not result in many
negative responses. For example, if an attacker portsweeps a web farm
for port 80, we will most likely not see many negative responses.

  * TCP Filtered Portscan
  * UDP Filtered Portscan
  * IP Filtered Portscan
  * TCP Filtered Decoy Portscan
  * UDP Filtered Decoy Portscan
  * IP Filtered Decoy Portscan
  * TCP Filtered Portsweep
  * UDP Filtered Portsweep
  * IP Filtered Portsweep
  * ICMP Filtered Portsweep
  * TCP Filtered Distributed Portscan
  * UDP Filtered Distributed Portscan
  * IP Filtered Distributed Portscan

"Filtered" alerts indicate that there were no network errors (ICMP
unreachables or TCP RSTs) or responses on closed ports have been
suppressed. It’s also a good indicator on whether the alert is just a
very active legitimate host. Active hosts, such as NATs, can trigger
these alerts because they can send out many connection attempts
within a very small amount of time. A filtered alert may go off
before responses from the remote hosts are received.

Portscan only generates one alert for each host pair in question
during the time window. On TCP scan alerts, Portscan will also
display any open ports that were scanned. On TCP sweep alerts
however, Portscan will only track open ports after the alert has been
triggered. Open port events are not individual alerts, but tags based
off the original scan alert.

5.17.2. Scan levels

There are 3 default scan levels that can be set.

1) default_hi_port_scan
2) default_med_port_scan
3) default_low_port_scan

Each of these default levels have separate options that can be edited
to alter the scan sensitivity levels (scans, rejects, nets or ports)

Example:

port_scan = default_low_port_scan

port_scan.tcp_decoy.ports = 1
port_scan.tcp_decoy.scans = 1
port_scan.tcp_decoy.rejects = 1
port_scan.tcp_ports.nets = 1

The example above would change each of the individual settings to 1.

NOTE:The default levels for scans, rejects, nets and ports can be
seen in the snort_defaults.lua file.

The counts can be seen in the alert outputs (-Acmg shown below):

50 72 69 6F 72 69 74 79  20 43 6F 75 6E 74 3A 20  Priority  Count:

72 6F 74 6F 20 52 61 6E  67 65 3A 20 31 3A 39 0A  roto Ran ge: 1:9.

"Low" alerts are only generated on error packets sent from the target
host, and because of the nature of error responses, this setting
should see very few false positives. However, this setting will never
trigger a Filtered Scan alert because of a lack of error responses.
This setting is based on a static time window of 60 seconds, after
which this window is reset.

"Medium" alerts track Connection Counts, and so will generate
Filtered Scan alerts. This setting may false positive on active hosts
(NATs, proxies, DNS caches, etc), so the user may need to deploy the
use of Ignore directives to properly tune this directive.

"High" alerts continuously track hosts on a network using a time
window to evaluate portscan statistics for that host. A "High"
setting will catch some slow scans because of the continuous
monitoring, but is very sensitive to active hosts. This most
definitely will require the user to tune Portscan.

5.17.3. Tuning Portscan

The most important aspect in detecting portscans is tuning the
detection engine for your network(s). Here are some tuning tips:

Use the watch_ip, ignore_scanners, and ignore_scanned options. It’s
important to correctly set these options. The watch_ip option is easy
to understand. The analyst should set this option to the list of CIDR
blocks and IPs that they want to watch. If no watch_ip is defined,
Portscan will watch all network traffic. The ignore_scanners and
ignore_scanned options come into play in weeding out legitimate hosts
that are very active on your network. Some of the most common
examples are NAT IPs, DNS cache servers, syslog servers, and nfs
servers. Portscan may not generate false positives for these types of
hosts, but be aware when first tuning Portscan for these IPs.
Depending on the type of alert that the host generates, the analyst
will know which to ignore it as. If the host is generating portsweep
events, then add it to the ignore_scanners option. If the host is
generating portscan alerts (and is the host that is being scanned),
add it to the ignore_scanned option.

Filtered scan alerts are much more prone to false positives. When
determining false positives, the alert type is very important. Most
of the false positives that Portscan may generate are of the filtered
scan alert type. So be much more suspicious of filtered portscans.
Many times this just indicates that a host was very active during the
time period in question. If the host continually generates these
types of alerts, add it to the ignore_scanners list or use a lower
sensitivity level.

Make use of the Priority Count, Connection Count, IP Count, Port
Count, IP range, and Port range to determine false positives. The
portscan alert details are vital in determining the scope of a
portscan and also the confidence of the portscan. In the future, we
hope to automate much of this analysis in assigning a scope level and
confidence level, but for now the user must manually do this. The
easiest way to determine false positives is through simple ratio
estimations. The following is a list of ratios to estimate and the
associated values that indicate a legitimate scan and not a false
positive.

Connection Count / IP Count: This ratio indicates an estimated
average of connections per IP. For portscans, this ratio should be
high, the higher the better. For portsweeps, this ratio should be
low.

Port Count / IP Count: This ratio indicates an estimated average of
ports connected to per IP. For portscans, this ratio should be high
and indicates that the scanned host’s ports were connected to by
fewer IPs. For portsweeps, this ratio should be low, indicating that
the scanning host connected to few ports but on many hosts.

Connection Count / Port Count: This ratio indicates an estimated
average of connections per port. For portscans, this ratio should be
low. This indicates that each connection was to a different port. For
portsweeps, this ratio should be high. This indicates that there were
many connections to the same port.

The reason that Priority Count is not included, is because the
priority count is included in the connection count and the above
comparisons take that into consideration. The Priority Count play an
important role in tuning because the higher the priority count the
more likely it is a real portscan or portsweep (unless the host is
firewalled).

If all else fails, lower the sensitivity level. If none of these
other tuning techniques work or the analyst doesn’t have the time for
tuning, lower the sensitivity level. You get the best protection the
higher the sensitivity level, but it’s also important that the
portscan detection engine generates alerts that the analyst will find
informative. The low sensitivity level only generates alerts based on
error responses. These responses indicate a portscan and the alerts
generated by the low sensitivity level are highly accurate and
require the least tuning. The low sensitivity level does not catch
filtered scans, since these are more prone to false positives.


5.18. Sensitive Data Filtering

--------------

The sd_pattern IPS option provides detection and filtering of
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This information includes
credit card numbers, U.S. Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and
email addresses. A rich regular expression syntax is available for
defining your own PII.

5.18.1. Hyperscan

The sd_pattern rule option is powered by the open source Hyperscan
library from Intel. It provides a regex grammar which is mostly PCRE
compatible. To learn more about Hyperscan see https://intel.github.io
/hyperscan/dev-reference/

5.18.2. Syntax

Snort provides sd_pattern as IPS rule option with no additional
inspector overhead. The Rule option takes the following syntax.

sd_pattern: "<pattern>"[, threshold <count>];

5.18.2.1. Pattern

Pattern is the most important and is the only required parameter to
sd_pattern. It supports 5 built-in patterns which are configured by
name: "credit_card", "us_social", "us_social_nodashes", "email", and
"us_phone" as well as user defined regular expressions of the
Hyperscan dialect (see https://intel.github.io/hyperscan/
dev-reference/compilation.html#pattern-support).

sd_pattern:"credit_card";

When configured, Snort will replace the pattern credit_card with the
built-in pattern. In addition to pattern matching, Snort will
validate that the matched digits will pass the Luhn-check algorithm.

sd_pattern:"us_social";
sd_pattern:"us_social_nodashes";

These special patterns will also be replaced with a built-in pattern.
Naturally, "us_social" is a pattern of 9 digits separated by -'s in
the canonical form. For this pattern, some validation of compliance
with the Social Security Numbers randomization rules is also
performed.

sd_pattern:"email";

This pattern will be replaced with a built-in pattern created to
match email. The regex implements the “preferred” syntax from RFC
1035 which is one of the recommendations in RFC 5322.

sd_pattern:"us_phone";

This pattern will match U.S. phone numbers in different formats with
or without country code.

sd_pattern:"\b\w+@ourdomain\.com\b"

This is a user defined pattern which matches what is most likely
email addresses for the site "ourdomain.com". The pattern is a PCRE
compatible regex, \b matches a word boundary (whitespace, end of
line, non-word characters) and \w+ matches one or more word
characters. \. matches a literal ..

The above pattern would match "a@ourdomain.com", "aa@ourdomain.com"
but would not match 1@ourdomain.com ab12@ourdomain.com or
@ourdomain.com.

Note: This is just an example, this pattern is not suitable to detect
many correctly formatted emails.

5.18.2.2. Threshold

Threshold is an optional parameter allowing you to change built-in
default value (default value is 1). The following two instances are
identical. The first will assume the default value of 1 the second
declaration explicitly sets the threshold to 1.

sd_pattern:"This rule requires 1 match";
sd_pattern:"This rule requires 1 match", threshold 1;

That’s pretty easy, but here is one more example anyway.

sd_pattern:"This is a string literal", threshold 300;

This example requires 300 matches of the pattern "This is a string
literal" to qualify as a positive match. That is, if the string only
occurred 299 times in a packet, you will not see an event.

5.18.2.3. Obfuscating built-in patterns

Snort provides discreet logging for the built-in patterns
"credit_card", "us_social", "us_social_nodashes", "us_phone", and
"email". Enabling ips.obfuscate_pii makes Snort obfuscate the suspect
packet payload which was matched by the patterns. This configuration
is enabled by default.

ips =
{
    obfuscate_pii = true
}

5.18.3. Examples

Complete Snort IPS rules with built-in sensitive data patterns.

alert tcp ( sid:1; msg:"Credit Card"; sd_pattern:"credit_card"; )
alert tcp ( sid:2; msg:"US Social Number"; sd_pattern:"us_social"; )
alert tcp ( sid:3; msg:"US Social Number No Dashes"; sd_pattern:"us_social_nodashes"; )
alert tcp ( sid:4; msg:"US Phone Number"; sd_pattern:"us_phone"; )
alert tcp ( sid:5; msg:"Email"; sd_pattern:"email"; )

Let’s try them on the next traffic.

Printout of alert_cmg logger for this would be obfuscated.

But obfuscation doesn’t work for custom patterns.

Example of a rule with a custom pattern.

alert tcp (sid: 6; sd_pattern:"\b\w+@ourdomain\.com\b"; msg: "Custom email")

Traffic.

61 40 6F 75 72 64 6F 6D 61 69  6E 2E 63 6F 6D 20 20 20 20 20  a@ourdomain.com

Printout of alert_cmg logger for this would not be obfuscated.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - -  - - - - -

Threshold values are applied per packet.

So, traffic like this.

Packet 1 payload:"a@ourdomain.com"
Packet 2 payload:"aa@ourdomain.com"

Doesn’t match a rule like this.

alert tcp (sid: 7; sd_pattern:"\b\w+@ourdomain\.com\b", threshold 2; msg: "Custom email")

5.18.4. Caveats

 1. sd_pattern implementation relies on Hyperscan, regardless of the
    search engine specified in the config. So, Snort must be built
    and run with Hyperscan to have sd_pattern IPS option available.
 2. Log obfuscation is only applicable to CMG and Unified2 logging
    formats.
 3. Log obfuscation doesn’t support user defined PII patterns. It is
    currently only supported for the built-in patterns for Credit
    Cards and U.S. Social Security numbers.
 4. Log obfuscation doesn’t work with stream rebuilt packet payloads.
    (This is a known bug).


5.19. SMTP

--------------

SMTP inspector is a service inspector for SMTP protocol.

5.19.1. Overview

The SMTP inspector examines SMTP connections looking for commands and
responses. It also identifies the command, header and body sections,
TLS data and extracts the MIME attachments. This inspector also
identifies and whitelists the SMTP traffic.

SMTP inspector logs the filename, email addresses, attachment names
when configured.

5.19.2. Configuration

SMTP command lines can be normalized to remove extraneous spaces.
TLS-encrypted traffic can be ignored, which improves performance. In
addition, plain-text mail data can be ignored for an additional
performance boost.

The configuration options are described below:

5.19.2.1. normalize and normalize_cmds

Normalization checks for more than one space character after a
command. Space characters are defined as space (ASCII 0x20) or tab
(ASCII 0x09). "normalize" provides options all|none|cmds, all checks
all commands, none turns off normalization for all commands. cmds
just checks commands listed with the "normalize_cmds" parameter. For
example:

smtp = { normalize = 'cmds', normalize_cmds = 'RCPT VRFY EXPN' }

5.19.2.2. ignore_data

Set it to true to ignore data section of mail (except for mail
headers) when processing rules.

5.19.2.3. ignore_tls_data

Set it to true to ignore TLS-encrypted data when processing rules.

5.19.2.4. max_command_line_len

Alert if an SMTP command line is longer than this value. Absence of
this option or a "0" means never alert on command line length. RFC
2821 recommends 512 as a maximum command line length.

5.19.2.5. max_header_line_len

Alert if an SMTP DATA header line is longer than this value. Absence
of this option or a "0" means never alert on data header line length.
RFC 2821 recommends 1024 as a maximum data header line length.

5.19.2.6. max_response_line_len

Alert if an SMTP response line is longer than this value. Absence of
this option or a "0" means never alert on response line length. RFC
2821 recommends 512 as a maximum response line length.

5.19.2.7. alt_max_command_line_len

Overrides max_command_line_len for specific commands For example:

alt_max_command_line_len =
{
    {
        command = 'MAIL',
        length = 260,
    },
    {
        command = 'RCPT',
        length = 300,
    },
}

5.19.2.8. invalid_cmds

Alert if this command is sent from client side.

5.19.2.9. valid_cmds

List of valid commands. We do not alert on commands in this list.

DEFAULT empty list, but SMTP inspector has this list hard-coded: [[
ATRN AUTH BDAT DATA DEBUG EHLO EMAL ESAM ESND ESOM ETRN EVFY EXPN
HELO HELP IDENT MAIL NOOP ONEX QUEU QUIT RCPT RSET SAML SEND SIZE
STARTTLS SOML TICK TIME TURN TURNME VERB VRFY X-EXPS X-LINK2STATE
XADR XAUTH XCIR XEXCH50 XGEN XLICENSE XQUE XSTA XTRN XUSR ]]

5.19.2.10. data_cmds

List of commands that initiate sending of data with an end of data
delimiter the same as that of the DATA command per RFC 5321 - "
<CRLF>.<CRLF>".

5.19.2.11. binary_data_cmds

List of commands that initiate sending of data and use a length value
after the command to indicate the amount of data to be sent, similar
to that of the BDAT command per RFC 3030.

5.19.2.12. auth_cmds

List of commands that initiate an authentication exchange between
client and server.

5.19.2.13. xlink2state

Enable/disable xlink2state alert, options are {disable | alert |
drop}. See CVE-2005-0560 for a description of the vulnerability.

5.19.2.14. MIME processing depth parameters

These four MIME processing depth parameters are identical to their
POP and IMAP counterparts. See that section for further details.

b64_decode_depth qp_decode_depth bitenc_decode_depth uu_decode_depth

5.19.2.15. Log Options

Following log options allow SMTP inspector to log email addresses and
filenames. Please note, this is logged only with the unified2 output
and is not logged with the console output (-A cmg). u2spewfoo can be
used to read this data from the unified2.

log_mailfrom

This option enables SMTP inspector to parse and log the sender’s
email address extracted from the "MAIL FROM" command along with all
the generated events for that session. The maximum number of bytes
logged for this option is 1024.

log_rcptto

This option enables SMTP inspector to parse and log the recipient
email addresses extracted from the "RCPT TO" command along with all
the generated events for that session. Multiple recipients are
appended with commas. The maximum number of bytes logged for this
option is 1024.

log_filename

This option enables SMTP inspector to parse and log the MIME
attachment filenames extracted from the Content-Disposition header
within the MIME body along with all the generated events for that
session. Multiple filenames are appended with commas. The maximum
number of bytes logged for this option is 1024.

log_email_hdrs

This option enables SMTP inspector to parse and log the SMTP email
headers extracted from SMTP data along with all generated events for
that session. The number of bytes extracted and logged depends upon
the email_hdrs_log_depth.

email_hdrs_log_depth

This option specifies the depth for logging email headers. The
allowed range for this option is 0 - 20480. A value of 0 will disable
email headers logging. The default value for this option is 1464.

5.19.3. Example

            length = 500,
        },
        {
            command = 'ETRN',
            length = 500,
        },
        {
            command = 'EXPN',
            length = 255,
        },
        {
            command = 'VRFY',
            length = 255,
        },
    },
}


5.20. Telnet

--------------

Given a telnet data buffer, Telnet will normalize the buffer with
respect to telnet commands and option negotiation, eliminating telnet
command sequences per RFC 854. It will also determine when a telnet
connection is encrypted, per the use of the telnet encryption option
per RFC 2946.

ayt_attack_thresh number

Detect and alert on consecutive are you there [AYT] commands beyond
the threshold number specified. This addresses a few specific
vulnerabilities relating to bsd-based implementations of telnet.


5.21. Trace

--------------

Snort 3 retired the different flavors of debug macros that used to be
set through the SNORT_DEBUG environment variable. It was replaced by
per-module trace functionality. Trace is turned on by setting the
specific trace module configuration in snort.lua. As before, to
enable debug tracing, Snort must be configured at build time with
--enable-debug-msgs. However, a growing number of modules (such as
wizard and snort.inspector_manager) are providing non-debug trace
messages in normal production builds.

5.21.1. Trace module

The trace module is responsible for configuring traces and supports
the following parameters:

output - configure the output method for trace messages
modules - trace configuration for specific modules
constraints - filter traces by the packet constraints
ntuple - on/off packet n-tuple info logging
timestamp - on/off message timestamps logging

The following lines, added in snort.lua, will enable trace messages
for detection and codec modules. The messages will be printed to
syslog if the packet filtering constraints match. Messages will be in
extended format, including timestamp and n-tuple packet info at the
beginning of each trace message.

trace =
{
    output = "syslog",
    modules =
    {
        detection = { detect_engine = 1 },
        decode = { all = 1 }
    },
    constraints =
    {
        ip_proto = 17,
        dst_ip = "10.1.1.2",
        src_port = 100,
        dst_port = 200
    },
    ntuple = true,
    timestamp = true
}

The trace module supports config reloading. Also, it’s possible to
set or clear modules traces and packet filter constraints via the
control channel command.

5.21.2. Trace module - configuring traces

The trace module has the modules option - a table with trace
configuration for specific modules. The following lines placed in
snort.lua will enable trace messages for detection, codec and wizard
modules:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        detection = { all = 1 },
        decode = { all = 1 },
        wizard = { all = 1 }
    }
}

The detection and snort modules are currently the only modules to
support multiple trace options. Others have only the default all
option, which will enable or disable all traces in a given module.
It’s available for multi-option modules also and works as a global
switcher:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        detection = { all = 1 }  -- set each detection option to level 1
    }
}

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        detection = { all = 1, tag = 2 }  -- set each detection option to level 1 but the 'tag' to level 2
    }
}

Also, it’s possible to enable or disable traces for all modules with
a top-level all option.

The following configuration states that:

  * all traces are enabled with verbosity level 5
  * traces for the decode module are enabled with level 3
  * rule_eval traces for the detection module are enabled with level
    1

    trace =
    {
        modules =
        {
            all = 5,
            decode = { all = 3 },
            detection = { rule_eval = 1 }
        }
    }

The full list of available trace parameters is placed into the "Basic
Modules.trace" chapter.

Each option must be assigned an integer value between 0 and 255 to
specify a level of verbosity for that option:

0 - turn off trace messages printing for the option
1 - print most significant trace messages for the option
255 - print all available trace messages for the option

Tracing is disabled by default (verbosity level equals 0). The
verbosity level is treated as a threshold, so specifying a higher
value will result in all messages with a lower level being printed as
well. For example:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        decode = { all = 3 }  -- messages with levels 1, 2, and 3 will be printed
    }
}

5.21.3. Trace module - configuring packet filter constraints for
packet related trace messages

There is a capability to filter traces by the packet constraints. The
trace module has the constraints option - a table with filtering
configuration that will be applied to all trace messages that include
a packet. Filtering is done on a flow that packet is related. By
default filtering is disabled.

Available constraints options:

ip_proto - numerical IP protocol ID
src_ip - match all packets with a flow that has this client IP address (passed as a string)
src_port - match all packets with a flow that has this source port
dst_ip - match all packets with a flow that has this server IP address (passed as a string)
dst_port - match all packets with a flow that has this destination port
match - boolean flag to enable/disable whether constraints will ever match (enabled by default)

The following lines placed in snort.lua will enable all trace
messages for detection filtered by ip_proto, dst_ip, src_port and
dst_port:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        detection = { all = 1 }
    },
    constraints =
    {
        ip_proto = 6, -- tcp
        dst_ip = "10.1.1.10",
        src_port = 150,
        dst_port = 250
    }
}

To create constraints that will never successfully match, set the 
match parameter to false. This is useful for situations where one is
relying on external packet filtering from the DAQ module, or for
preventing all trace messages in the context of a packet. The
following is an example of such configuration:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        snort = { all = 1 }
    },
    constraints =
    {
        match = false
    }
}

5.21.4. Trace module - configuring trace output method

There is a capability to configure the output method for trace
messages. The trace module has the output option with two acceptable
values:

"stdout" - printing to stdout
"syslog" - printing to syslog

By default, the output method will be set based on the Snort run
mode. Normally it will use stdout, but if -D (daemon mode) and/or -M
(alert-syslog mode) are set, it will instead use syslog.

Example - set output method as syslog:

In snort.lua, the following lines were added:

trace =
{
    output = "syslog",
    modules =
    {
        detection = { all = 1 }
    }
}

As a result, each trace message will be printed into syslog (the
Snort run-mode will be ignored).

5.21.5. Configuring traces via control channel command

There is a capability to configure module trace options and packet
constraints via the control channel command by using a Snort shell.
In order to enable shell, Snort has to be configured and built with
--enable-shell.

The trace control channel command is a way how to configure module
trace options and/or packet filter constraints directly during Snort
run and without reloading the entire config.

Control channel also allow adjusting trace output format by setting
ntuple and timestamp switchers.

After entering the Snort shell, there are two commands available for
the trace module:

trace.set({ modules = {...}, constraints = {...} }) - set modules traces and constraints (should pass a valid Lua-entry)

trace.set({ modules = { all = N } }) - enable traces for all modules with verbosity level N

trace.set({ ntuple = true/false }) - on/off packet n-tuple info logging

trace.set({ timestamp = true/false }) - on/off timestamp logging

trace.clear() - clear modules traces and constraints

Also, it’s possible to omit tables in the trace.set() command:

trace.set({constraints = {...}}) - set only filtering configuration keeping old modules traces

trace.set({modules = {...}}) - set only module trace options keeping old filtering constraints

trace.set({}) - disable traces and constraints (set to empty)

5.21.6. Trace messages format

Each tracing message has a standard format:

<module_name>:<option_name>:<message_log_level>: <particular_message>

The stdout logger also prints thread type and thread instance ID at
the beginning of each trace message in a colon-separated manner.

The capital letter at the beginning of the trace message indicates
the thread type.

Possible thread types: C – main (control) thread P – packet thread O
– other thread

Setting the option - ntuple allows you to change the trace message
format, expanding it with information about the processed packet.

It will be added at the beginning, right after the thread type and
instance ID, in the following format:

src_ip src_port -> dst_ip dst_port ip_proto AS=address_space

Where:

src_ip - source IP address
src_port - source port
dst_ip - destination IP address
dst_port - destination port
ip_proto - IP protocol ID
address_space - unique ID of the address space

Those info can be displayed only for IP packets. Port defaults to
zero if a packet doesn’t have it.

The timestamp option extends output format by logging the message
time in the next format:

MM/DD-hh:mm:ss.SSSSSS

Where:

M – month
D – day
h – hours
m – minutes
s – seconds
S – milliseconds

5.21.7. Example - Debugging rules using detection trace

The detection engine is responsible for rule evaluation. Turning on
the trace for it can help with debugging new rules.

The relevant options for detection are as follow:

rule_eval - follow rule evaluation
buffer - print evaluated buffer if it changed (level 1) or at every step (level 5)
rule_vars - print value of ips rule options vars
fp_search - print information on fast pattern search

Buffer print is useful, but in case the buffer is very big can be too
verbose. Choose between verbosity levels 1, 5, or no buffer trace
accordingly.

rule_vars is useful when the rule is using ips rule options vars.

In snort.lua, the following lines were added:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        detection =
        {
            rule_eval = 1,
            buffer = 1,
            rule_vars = 1,
            fp_search = 1
        }
    }
}

The pcap has a single packet with payload:

10.AAAAAAAfoobar

Evaluated on rules:

# byte_math + oper with byte extract and content
# VAL = 1, byte_math = 0 + 10
alert tcp ( byte_extract: 1, 0, VAL, string, dec;
byte_math:bytes 1,offset VAL,oper +, rvalue 10, result var1, string dec;
content:"foo", offset var1; sid:3)

#This rule should not trigger
alert tcp (content:"AAAAA"; byte_jump:2,0,relative;
content:"foo", within 3; sid:2)

The output:

detection:rule_eval:1: packet 1 C2S 127.0.0.1:1234 127.0.0.1:5678 (fast-patterns)
detection:rule_eval:1: Fast pattern search

5.21.8. Example - Protocols decoding trace

Turning on decode trace will print out information about the packets
decoded protocols. Can be useful in case of tunneling.

Example for a icmpv4-in-ipv6 packet:

In snort.lua, the following line was added:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        decode = { all = 1 }
    }
}

The output:

decode:all:1: Codec eth (protocol_id: 34525) ip header starts at: 0x7f70800110f0, length is 14
decode:all:1: Codec ipv6 (protocol_id: 1) ip header starts at: 0x7f70800110f0, length is 40
decode:all:1: Codec icmp4 (protocol_id: 256) ip header starts at: 0x7f70800110f0, length is 8
decode:all:1: Codec unknown (protocol_id: 256) ip header starts at: 0x7f70800110f0, length is 0

5.21.9. Example - Track the time packet spends in each inspector

There is a capability to track which inspectors evaluate a packet,
and how much time the inspector consumes doing so. These trace
messages could be enabled by the Snort module trace options:

main - command execution traces (main trace logging)
inspector_manager - inspectors execution and time tracking traces

Example for a single packet with payload:

10.AAAAAAAfoobar

In snort.lua, the following lines were added:

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        snort =
        {
            -- could be replaced by 'all = 1'
            main = 1,
            inspector_manager = 1
        }
    }
}

The output:

snort:main:1: [0] Queuing command START for execution (refcount 1)
snort:main:1: [0] Queuing command RUN for execution (refcount 1)
snort:main:1: [0] Destroying completed command START

5.21.10. Example - trace filtering by packet constraints:

In snort.lua, the following lines were added:

ips =
{
    rules =
    [[
        alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg: "ALERT_TCP"; gid: 1001; sid: 1001 )
        alert udp any any -> any any ( msg: "ALERT_UDP"; gid: 1002; sid: 1002 )
    ]]
}

trace =
{
    modules =
    {
        detection = { rule_eval = 1 }
    },
    constraints =
    {
        ip_proto = 17, -- udp
        dst_ip = "10.1.1.2",
        src_port = 100,
        dst_port = 200
    }
}

The processed traffic was next:

The trace messages for two last packets (numbers 5 and 6) weren’t
printed.

5.21.11. Example - configuring traces via trace.set() command

In snort.lua, the following lines were added:

ips =
{
    rules =
    [[
        alert tcp any any -> any any ( msg: "ALERT_TCP"; gid: 1001; sid: 1001 )
        alert udp any any -> any any ( msg: "ALERT_UDP"; gid: 1002; sid: 1002 )
    ]]
}

trace =
{
    constraints =
    {
        ip_proto = 17, -- udp
        dst_ip = "10.1.1.2",
        src_port = 100,
        dst_port = 200
    },
    modules =
    {
        detection = { rule_eval = 1 }
    }
}

The processed traffic was next:

# Flow 1
d ( stack="eth:ip4:udp" )
c ( ip4:a="10.1.1.1", ip4:b="10.1.1.2", udp:a=100, udp:b=200 )

a ( syn )
b ( syn, ack )
a ( ack )
a ( ack, data="tcp packet 1" )
a ( ack, data="tcp packet 2" )

After 1 packet, entering shell and pass the trace.set() command as
follows:

trace.set({ constraints = { ip_proto = 6, dst_ip = "10.1.1.4", src_port = 5000, dst_port = 6000 }, modules = { decode = { all = 1 }, detection = { rule_eval = 1 } } })

The output (not full, only descriptive lines):

detection:rule_eval:1: packet 1 UNK 10.1.1.1:100 10.1.1.2:200 (fast-patterns)
detection:rule_eval:1: packet 1 UNK 10.1.1.1:100 10.1.1.2:200 (non-fast-patterns)

detection:rule_eval:1: packet 9 UNK 10.1.1.4:6000 10.1.1.3:5000 (non-fast-patterns)

The new configuration was applied. decode:all:1 messages aren’t
filtered because they don’t include a packet (a packet isn’t
well-formed at the point when the message is printing).

5.21.12. Other available traces

There are more trace options supported by detection:

detect_engine - prints statistics about the engine
pkt_detect - prints a message when disabling content detect for packet
opt_tree - prints option tree data structure
tag - prints a message when a new tag is added

The rest support only 1 option, and can be turned on by adding all =
1 to their table in trace lua config.

  * stream module trace:

When turned on prints a message in case inspection is stopped on a
flow. Example for output:

stream:all:1: stop inspection on flow, dir BOTH

  * stream_ip, stream_user: trace will output general processing
    messages

Other modules that support trace have messages as seemed fit to the
developer. Some are for corner cases, others for complex data
structures.


5.22. Wizard

--------------

Using the wizard enables port-independent configuration and the
detection of malware command and control channels. If the wizard is
bound to a session, it peeks at the initial payload to determine the
service. For example, GET would indicate HTTP and HELO would indicate
SMTP. Upon finding a match, the service bindings are reevaluated so
the session can be handed off to the appropriate inspector. The
wizard is still under development; if you find you need to tweak the
defaults please let us know.

5.22.1. Wizard patterns

Wizard supports 3 kinds of patterns:

 1. Hexes
 2. Spells
 3. Curses

Each kind of pattern has its own purpose and features. It should be
noted that the types of patterns are evaluated exactly in the order
in which they are described above. Thus, if some data matches a hex,
it will not be processed by spells and curses.

The depth of search for a pattern in the data can be configured using
the max_search_depth option

TCP packets form a flow, so wizard checks all data in the flow for a
match. If no pattern matches and max_search_depth is reached, the
flow is abandoned by wizard.

UDP packets form a "meta-flow" based on the addresses and ports of
the packets. However, unlike TCP processing, for UDP wizard only
looks at the first arriving packet from the meta-flow. If no pattern
matches that packet or wizard’s max_search_depth is reached, the
meta-flow is abandoned by wizard.

5.22.2. Wizard patterns - Spells

Spell is a text based pattern. The best area of usage - text
protocols: http, smtp, sip, etc. Spells are:

  * Case insensitive
  * Whitespace sensitive
  * Able to match by a wildcard symbol

In order to match any sequence of characters in pattern, you should
use "*" (glob) symbol in pattern.

Example:
  Pattern: '220-*FTP'
  Traffic that would match: '220- Hello world! It's a new FTP server'

To escape "*" symbol, put "**" in the pattern.

Spells are configured as a Lua array, each element of which can
contain following options:

  * service - name of the service that would be assigned
  * proto - protocol to scan
  * to_server - list of text patterns to search in the data sent to
    the client
  * to_client - list of text patterns to search in the data sent to
    the server

    Example of a spell definition in Lua:
      {
        service = 'smtp',
        proto = 'tcp',
        to_server = { 'HELO', 'EHLO' },
        to_client = { '220*SMTP', '220*MAIL' }
      }

5.22.3. Wizard patterns - Hexes

Hexes can be used to match binary protocols: dnp3, http2, ssl, etc.
Hexes use hexadecimal representation of the data for pattern
matching.

Wildcard in hex pattern is a placeholder for exactly one occurrence
of any hexadecimal digit and denoted by the symbol "?".

Example:
  Pattern: '|05 ?4|'
  Traffic that would match: '|05 84|'

Hexes are configured in the same way as spells and have an identical
set of options.

Example of a hex definition in Lua:
  {
    service = 'dnp3',
    proto = 'tcp',
    to_server = { '|05 64|' },
    to_client = { '|05 64|' }
  }

5.22.4. Wizard patterns - Curses

Curses are internal algorithms of service identification. They are
implemented as state machines in C++ code and can have their own
unique state information stored on the flow.

A list of available services can be obtained using snort
--help-config wizard | grep curses.

A configuration which enables some curses:
  curses = {'dce_udp', 'dce_tcp', 'dce_smb', 'sslv2'}

5.22.5. Additional Details:

  * Note that usually more specific patterns have higher precedence.

    For example:
      The following spells against 'foobar' payload. The 3rd spell matches.
        { service = 'first',  to_server = { 'foo' } },
        { service = 'second',  to_server = { 'bar' } }
        { service = 'third',  to_server = { 'foobar' } }

  * If the wizard and one or more service inspectors are configured w
    /o explicitly configuring the binder, default bindings will be
    generated which should work for most common cases.
  * Also note that while Snort 2 bindings can only be configured in
    the default policy, each Snort 3 policy can contain a binder
    leading to an arbitrary hierarchy.
  * The entire configuration can be reloaded and hot-swapped during
    run-time via signal or command in both Snort 2 and Snort 3.
    Ultimately, Snort 3 will support commands to update the binder on
    the fly, thus enabling incremental reloads of individual
    inspectors.
  * Both Snort 2 and Snort 3 support server specific configurations
    via a hosts table (XML in Snort 2 and Lua in Snort 3). The table
    allows you to map network, protocol, and port to a service and
    policy. This table can be reloaded and hot-swapped separately
    from the config file.
  * You can find the specifics on the binder, wizard, and hosts
    tables in the manual or command line like this: snort
    --help-module binder, etc.

6. DAQ Configuration and Modules

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Data AcQuisition library (DAQ), provides pluggable packet I/O.
LibDAQ replaces direct calls to libraries like libpcap with an
abstraction layer that facilitates operation on a variety of hardware
and software interfaces without requiring changes to Snort. It is
possible to select the DAQ module and mode when invoking Snort to
perform pcap readback or inline operation, etc. The DAQ library may
be useful for other packet processing applications and the modular
nature allows you to build new modules for other platforms.

The DAQ library exists as a separate repository on the official Snort
3 GitHub project (https://github.com/snort3/libdaq) and contains a
number of bundled DAQ modules including AFPacket, Divert, NFQ, PCAP,
and Netmap implementations. Snort 3 itself contains a few new DAQ
modules mostly used for testing as described below. Additionally, DAQ
modules developed by third parties to facilitate the usage of their
own hardware and software platforms exist.


6.1. Building the DAQ Library and Its Bundled DAQ Modules

--------------

Refer to the READMEs in the LibDAQ source tarball for instructions on
how to build the library and modules as well as details on
configuring and using the bundled DAQ modules.


6.2. Configuration

--------------

As with a number of features in Snort 3, the LibDAQ and DAQ module
configuration may be controlled using either the command line options
or by configuring the daq Snort module in the Lua configuration
(command line option has higher precedence).

DAQ modules may be statically built into Snort, but the more common
case is to use DAQ modules that have been built as dynamically
loadable objects. Because of this, the first thing to take care of is
informing Snort of any locations it should search for dynamic DAQ
modules. From the command line, this can be done with one or more
invocations of the --daq-dir option, which takes a colon-separated
set of paths to search as its argument. All arguments will be
collected into a list of locations to be searched. In the Lua
configuration, the daq.module_dirs[] property is a list of paths for
the same purpose.

Next, one must select which DAQ modules they wish to use by name. At
least one base module and zero or more wrapper modules may be
selected. This is done using the --daq options from the command line
or the daq.modules[] list-type property. To get a list of the
available modules, run Snort with the --daq-list option making sure
to specify any DAQ module search directories beforehand. If no DAQ
module is specified, Snort will default to attempting to find and use
a DAQ module named pcap.

Some DAQ modules can be further directly configured using DAQ module
variables. All DAQ module variables come in the form of either just a
key or a key and a value separated by an equals sign. For example, 
debug or fanout_type=hash. The command line option for specifying
these is --daq-var and the configuration file equivalent is the 
daq.modules[].variables[] property. The available variables for each
module will be shown when listing the available DAQ modules with
--daq-list.

The LibDAQ concept of operational mode (passive, inline, or file
readback) is automatically configured based on inferring the mode
from other Snort configuration. The presence of -r or --pcap-*
options implies read-file, -i without -Q implies passive, and -i with
-Q implies inline. The mode can be overridden on a per-DAQ module
basis with the --daq-mode option on the command line or the 
daq.modules[].mode property.

The DAQ module receive timeout is always configured to 1 second. The
packet capture length (snaplen) defaults to 1518 bytes and can be
overridden by the -s command line option or daq.snaplen property.

Finally, and most importantly, is the input specification for the DAQ
module. In readback mode, this is simply the file to be read back and
analyzed. For live traffic processing, this is the name of the
interface or other necessary input specification as required by the
DAQ module to understand what to operate upon. From the command line,
the -r option is used to specify a file to be read back and the -i
option is used to indicate a live interface input specification. Both
are covered by the daq.inputs[] property.

For advanced use cases, one additional LibDAQ configuration exists:
the number of DAQ messages to request per receive call. In Snort,
this is referred to as the DAQ "batch size" and defaults to 64. The
default can be overridden with the --daq-batch-size command line
option or daq.batch_size property. The message pool size requested
from the DAQ module will be four times this batch size.

6.2.1. Command Line Example

    snort --daq-dir /usr/local/lib/daq --daq-dir /opt/lib/daq --daq afpacket
--daq-var debug --daq-var fanout_type=hash -i eth1:eth2 -Q

6.2.2. Configuration File Example

The following is the equivalent of the above command line DAQ
configuration in Lua form:

daq =
{
    module_dirs =
    {
        '/usr/local/lib/daq',
        '/opt/lib/daq'
    },
    modules =
    {
        {
            name = 'afpacket',
            mode = 'inline',
            variables =
            {
                'debug',
                'fanout_type=hash'
            }
        }
    },
    inputs =
    {
        'eth1:eth2',
    },
    snaplen = 1518
}

The daq.snaplen property was included for completeness and may be
omitted if the default value is acceptable.

6.2.3. DAQ Module Configuration Stacks

Like briefly mentioned above, a DAQ configuration consists of a base
DAQ module and zero or more wrapper DAQ modules. DAQ wrapper modules
provide additional functionality layered on top of the base module in
a decorator pattern. For example, the Dump DAQ module will capture
all passed or injected packets and save them to a PCAP savefile. This
can be layered on top of something like the PCAP DAQ module to assess
which packets are making it through Snort without being dropped and
what actions Snort has taken that involved sending new or modified
packets out onto the network (e.g., TCP reset packets and TCP
normalizations).

To configure a DAQ module stack from the command line, the --daq
option must be given multiple times with the base module specified
first followed by the wrapper modules in the desired order (building
up the stack). Each --daq option changes which module is being
configured by subsequent --daq-var and --daq mode options.

When configuring the same sort of stack in Lua, everything lives in
the daq.modules[] property. daq.modules[] is an array of module
configurations pushed onto the stack from top to bottom. Each module
configuration must contain the name of the DAQ module. Additionally,
it may contain an array of variables (daq.modules[].variables[]) and/
or an operational mode (daq.modules[].mode).

If only wrapper modules were specified, Snort will default to
implicitly configuring a base module with the name pcap in read-file
mode. This is a convenience to mimic the previous behavior when
selecting something like the old Dump DAQ module that may be removed
in the future.

For any particularly complicated setup, it is recommended that one
configure via a Lua configuration file rather than using the command
line options.


6.3. Interaction With Multiple Packet Threads

--------------

All packet threads will receive the same DAQ instance configuration
with the potential exception of the input specification.

If Snort is in file readback mode, a full set of files will be
constructed from the -r/--pcap-file/--pcap-list/--pcap-dir/
--pcap-filter options. A number of packet threads will be started up
to the configured maximum (-z) to process these files one at a time.
As a packet thread completes processing of a file, it will be stopped
and then started again with a different file input to process. If the
number of packet threads configured exceeds the number of files to
process, or as the number of remaining input files dwindles below
that number, Snort will stop spawning new packet threads when it runs
out of unhandled input files.

When Snort is operating on live interfaces (-i), all packet threads
up to the configured maximum will always be started. By default, if
only one input specification is given, all packet threads will
receive the same input in their configuration. If multiple inputs are
given, each thread will be given the matching input (ordinally),
falling back to the first if the number of packet threads exceeds the
number of inputs.


6.4. DAQ Modules Included With Snort 3

--------------

6.4.1. Socket Module

The socket module provides provides a stream socket server that will
accept up to 2 simultaneous connections and bridge them together
while also passing data to Snort for inspection. The first connection
accepted is considered the client and the second connection accepted
is considered the server. If there is only one connection, stream
data can’t be forwarded but it is still inspected.

Each read from a socket of up to snaplen bytes is passed as a packet
to Snort along with the ability to retrieve a DAQ_UsrHdr_t structure
via ioctl. DAQ_UsrHdr_t conveys IP4 address, ports, protocol, and
direction. Socket packets can be configured to be TCP or UDP. The
socket DAQ can be operated in inline mode and is able to block
packets.

Packets from the socket DAQ module are handled by Snort’s stream_user
module, which must be configured in the Snort configuration.

To use the socket DAQ, start Snort like this:

./snort --daq-dir /path/to/lib/snort_extra/daq \
    --daq socket [--daq-var port=<port>] [--daq-var proto=<proto>] [-Q]

<port> ::= 1..65535; default is 8000
<proto> ::= tcp | udp

  * This module only supports ip4 traffic.
  * This module is only supported by Snort 3. It is not compatible
    with Snort 2.
  * This module is primarily for development and test.

6.4.2. File Module

The file module provides the ability to process files directly
without having to extract them from pcaps. Use the file module with
Snort’s stream_file to get file type identification and signature
services. The usual IPS detection and logging, etc. is also
available.

You can process all the files in a directory recursively using 8
threads with these Snort options:

--pcap-dir path -z 8

  * This module is only supported by Snort 3. It is not compatible
    with Snort 2.
  * This module is primarily for development and test.

6.4.3. Hext Module

The hext module generates packets suitable for processing by Snort
from hex/plain text. Raw packets include full headers and are
processed normally. Otherwise the packets contain only payload and
are accompanied with flow information (4-tuple) suitable for
processing by stream_user.

The first character of the line determines it’s purpose:

'$' command
'#' comment
'"' quoted string packet data
'x' hex packet data
' ' empty line separates packets

The available commands are:

$client <ip4> <port>
$server <ip4> <port>

$packet -> client
$packet -> server

$packet <addr> <port> -> <addr> <port>

$sof <i32:ingressZone> <i32:egressZone> <i32:ingressIntf> <i32:egressIntf> <s:srcIp> <i16:srcPort> <s:destIp> <i16:dstPort> <u32:opaque> <u64:initiatorPkts> <u64:responderPkts> <u64:initiatorPktsDropped> <u64:responderPktsDropped> <u64:initiatorBytesDropped> <u64:responderBytesDropped> <u8:isQosAppliedOnSrcIntf> <timeval:sof_timestamp> <timeval:eof_timestamp> <u32:address_space_id> <u32:tenant_id> <u16:vlan> <u8:protocol> <u8:flags>
$eof <i32:ingressZone> <i32:egressZone> <i32:ingressIntf> <i32:egressIntf> <s:srcIp> <i16:srcPort> <s:destIp> <i16:dstPort> <u32:opaque> <u64:initiatorPkts> <u64:responderPkts> <u64:initiatorPktsDropped> <u64:responderPktsDropped> <u64:initiatorBytesDropped> <u64:responderBytesDropped> <u8:isQosAppliedOnSrcIntf> <timeval:sof_timestamp> <timeval:eof_timestamp> <u32:address_space_id> <u32:tenant_id> <u16:vlan> <u8:protocol> <u8:flags>

Client and server are determined as follows. $packet → client
indicates to the client (from server) and $packet → server indicates
a packet to the server (from client). $packet followed by a 4-tuple
uses the heuristic that the client is the side with the greater port
number.

The default client and server are 192.168.1.1 12345 and 10.1.2.3 80
respectively. $packet commands with a 4-tuple do not change client
and server set with the other $packet commands.

$packet commands should be followed by packet data, which may contain
any combination of hex and strings. Data for a packet ends with the
next command or a blank line. Data after a blank line will start
another packet with the same tuple as the prior one.

$sof and $eof commands generate Start of Flow and End of Flow
metapackets respectively. They are followed by a definition of a
DAQ_FlowStats_t data structure which will be fed into Snort via the
metadata callback.

Strings may contain the following escape sequences:

\r = 0x0D = carriage return
\n = 0x0A = new line
\t = 0x09 = tab
\\ = 0x5C = \

Format your input carefully; there is minimal error checking and
little tolerance for arbitrary whitespace. You can use Snort’s -L
hext option to generate hext input from a pcap.

  * This module only supports ip4 traffic.
  * This module is only supported by Snort 3. It is not compatible
    with Snort 2.
  * This module is primarily for development and test.

The hext DAQ also supports a raw mode which is activated by setting
the data link type. For example, you can input full ethernet packets
with --daq-var dlt=1 (Data link types are defined in the DAQ include
sfbpf_dlt.h.) Combine that with the hext logger in raw mode for a
quick (and dirty) way to edit pcaps. With --lua "log_hext = { raw =
true }", the hext logger will dump the full packet in a way that can
be read by the hext DAQ in raw mode. Here is an example:

# 3 [96]

x02 09 08 07 06 05 02 01 02 03 04 05 08 00 45 00 00 52 00 03  # ..............E..R..
x00 00 40 06 5C 90 0A 01 02 03 0A 09 08 07 BD EC 00 50 00 00  # ..@.\............P..
x00 02 00 00 00 02 50 10 20 00 8A E1 00 00 47 45 54 20 2F 74  # ......P.  .....GET /t
x72 69 67 67 65 72 2F 31 20 48 54 54 50 2F 31 2E 31 0D 0A 48  # rigger/1 HTTP/1.1..H
x6F 73 74 3A 20 6C 6F 63 61 6C 68 6F 73 74 0D 0A              # ost: localhost..

A comment indicating packet number and size precedes each packet
dump. Note that the commands are not applicable in raw mode and have
no effect.
