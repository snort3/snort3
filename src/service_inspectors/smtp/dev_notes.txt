This directory contains all files related to SMTP protocol processing.

The protocol aware flushing for SMTP determines SMTP PDU and this
reassembled SMTP PDU is processed by the SMTP inspector. Both SMTP
requests/responses are parsed and the MIME attachments in SMTP responses
are processed using the file API. The file API extracts and decodes the
attachments. file_data is then set to the start of these extracted/decoded
attachments. This inspector also identifies and whitelists the SMTPS
traffic.

SMTP inspector logs the filename, email addresses, attachment names when
configured.  The SMTP commands are also normalized based on the config.
