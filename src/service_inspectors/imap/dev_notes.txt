This directory contains all files related to IMAP protocol processing.  The
protocol aware flushing for IMAP determines IMAP PDU and this reassembled
IMAP PDU is processed by the IMAP inspector. Both IMAP requests/responses
are parsed and the MIME attachments in IMAP responses are processed using
the file API. The file API extracts and decodes the attachments. file_data
is then set to the start of these extracted/decoded attachments. This
inspector also identifies and whitelists the IMAPS traffic.

IMAP inspector uses PDFJSNorm class to extract and normalize JavaScript
in PDF files. The normalized JavaScript is then available in the js_data buffer.
The js_data buffer follows the JIT approach, thus, to perform the normalization,
the rule with the js_data IPS option must be present as well as the js_norm module
is configured.
