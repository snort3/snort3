The HTTP/2 inspector (H2I) will convert HTTP/2 frames into HTTP/1.1 message sections and feed them
to the new HTTP inspector (NHI) for further processing.

The current implementation is the very first step. It splits an HTTP/2 stream into frame sections
and forwards them for inspection. It does not interface with NHI and does not address the
multiplexed nature of HTTP/2.

The Http2StreamSplitter strips the frame headers from the frame data and stores them in separate
buffers. As in NHI, long data frames are split into 16kb chunks for inspection. If a header frame
is followed by continuation frames, all the header frames are flushed together for inspection. The
frame headers from each frame are stored contiguously in the frame_header buffer. After cutting out
the frame headers, the frame data is stored as a single block, consisting of the HPACK encoded
HTTP/2 headers.

HPACK decoding is under ongoing development. In the current implementation, reassemble() makes a
first copy of the encoded headers, which is stored in the frame_data buffer. The frame_data buffer
is passed to the function decode_headers(), which is the main loop driving HPACK decoding. The
function allocates a second buffer, raw_decoded_header, to which the decoding routine will
progressively write. As part of decoding the pseudo-headers (described below), data that must not be
sent to NHI may be written to the start of the buffer. In order to avoid making any extra copies,
the decoding routine sets a pointer to the start of the regular headers inside raw_decoded_header
that will be processed by NHI, called http2_decoded_header.

The main loop in decode_headers() finds the cut point for a single header line. The line is is
passed to decode_header_line(), which parses the line and calls the appropriate decoding function
based on the header representation type. If the type is indexed, the full header line is looked up
in the table and copied to the decoded header buffer. The index may belong to either the static or
the dynamic table. The static table is 61-elements defined in the HPACK RFC. The dynamic table,
which starts at index 62, is specific to each direction of each flow. For the second type, literal
to be indexed, the header name may be indexed or a string literal, while the value is always a
literal. The resulting header line will then be added to the dynamic table (not yet implemented).
The third representation type is literal not to be indexed, which is the same as literal to be
indexed, except the header line is not added to the dynamic table.

HTTP/2 uses pseudo-headers to convey the information included in an HTTP/1.1 start-line.
Pseudo-headers are not valid HTTP/1.1 headers, so must be translated into a start-line before the
decoded headers can be passed to NHI. The two Http2StartLine subclasses, Http2RequestLine and
Http2ResponseLine perform this translation and generate the start-line, which is stored in a new
buffer inside the Http2StartLine object. The start-line buffer must be passed to NHI before the
http2_decoded_header buffer, which contains the regular HTTP/1.1 headers. Note that HTTP/2 does not
use status reason phrases, so the status line passed to NHI will not include one. It will include
only the HTTP version and the status code. 

H2I supports the NHI test tool. See ../http_inspect/dev_notes.txt for usage instructions.
