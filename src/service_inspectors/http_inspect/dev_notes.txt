The HTTP inspector (HI) is divided into two major parts. The HttpStreamSplitter (splitter) accepts
TCP payload data from Stream and subdivides it into message sections. HttpInspect (inspector)
processes individual message sections.

Splitter finish() is called by Stream when the TCP connection closes (including pruning).
It serves several specialized purposes in cases where the HTTP message is truncated (ends
unexpectedly).

The nature of splitting allows packets to be forwarded before they are aggregated into a message
section and inspected. This may lead to problems when the target consumes a partial message
body even though the end of the message body was never received because Snort blocked it.

Script detection is a feature developed to solve this problem for message bodies containing
Javascripts. The stream splitter scan() method searches its input for the end-of-script tag
"</script>". When necessary this requires scan() to unzip the data. This is an extra unzip as
storage limitations preclude saving the unzipped version of the data for subsequent reassembly.

Update: the previous sentence has been discovered to be incorrect. The memory requirements of
zlib are very large. It would save a lot of memory and some processing time for script detection
to unzip one time in scan() and store the result for eventual use by reassemble(). The memory
lost by storing partial message sections in HI while waiting for reassemble() would be more than
compensated for by not having two instances of zlib.

HttpFlowData is a data class representing all HI information relating to a flow. It serves as
persistent memory between invocations of HI by the framework. It also glues together the inspector,
the client-to-server splitter, and the server-to-client splitter which pass information through the
flow data.

An HttpTransaction is a container that keeps all the sections of a message together and associates
the request message with the response message. Transactions may be organized into pipelines when an
HTTP pipeline is present. The current transaction and any pipeline live in the flow data. A
transaction may have only a request because the response is not (yet) received or only a response
because the corresponding request is unknown or unavailable.

The attach_my_transaction() factory method contains all the logic that makes this work. There are
many corner cases. Don't mess with it until you fully understand it.

HI implements flow depth using the request_depth and response_depth parameters. HI seeks to provide
a consistent experience to detection by making flow depth independent of factors that a sender
could easily manipulate, such as header length, chunking, compression, and encodings. The maximum
depth is computed against normalized message body data.
