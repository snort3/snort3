This unit supports parsing of command line args, detection rules, IP addresses,
and config files. New Lua-based features are elsewhere.

==== Rules

A state machine parser expects a rule in the following format:

    Action Proto Source Dir Destination ( Options )

Where 'Action' is an IPS Action, 'Source/Destination' is a source or destination
IP address and port if any, 'Dir' is a marker for uni-directional or bi-directional
rule, 'Options' is a list of IPS options including matchers and meta-data.
Some of the tokens can be omitted, taking a default value.

The left part of the rule (before the opening parenthesis) is a header, which is
represented by RuleTreeNode structure internally, the RTN.

The right part of the rule (in the parentheses) is a rule body, which is just
a list of IPS options, delimited by a semi-colon. Internally this part is
represented by OptTreeNode structure, the OTN.
During parsing the options, the right IPS Option module is selected. It will
parse the option and its parameters and create an instance.

RTN is a per-policy data. Within a given policy all RTNs which have the
same action and 5-tuple (protocol, addresses, ports values after expanding
variables) will be collapsed into a single RTN. This reduces the memory and
computation efforts to evaluate RTN. Hence, RTN has a counter for OTNs
referencing it.
RTNs populate policies when the rule states are applied.

OTN is a global data. It is uniquely identified by gid:sid pair.
So, a text rule, a rule state or stub can reference the same rule:

    ips.rules = [[ reject http ( gid:1; sid:1; ) ]]
    ips.states = [[ alert ( gid:1; sid:1; ) ]]

In the example above the state will affect the current policy, while the rule
will be loaded and become available in all policies (with inherited or
overridden state).
OTN has a pointer to the right RTN for each policy.

After all the rules are read and parsed, Detection module will create rule
groups and options trees to evaluate rules faster.

==== IP and Port Variables

IP or Port value (either a scalar or a list) can be represented by a user variable.
Each IPS policy has a table which maps variable name to a specific value.

    ips.variables.nets.HOME_NET = 192.168.0.0/24
    ips.variables.ports.STATIC_NAT_PORT = '8080, 40000:'

RTN gets expanded values when the rule state is applied.
