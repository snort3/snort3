This directory contains the implementation of the Stream preprocessor
components:

* Stream constants and data types used across stream components or by
  clients of the stream API.

* Prototype definitions and implementation for all stream API methods.

* Virtual base class defining the Stream Splitter interface.
  Implementation of stream splitters for accumulated TCP over maximum
  flushing (atom splitter) and length of given segment flushing (log
  splitter).

* Prototype definitions and implementation for the stream Protocol Aware
  Flushing API methods (PAF is now realized by stream splitter subclasses).

Major subcomponents of the Stream inspector are each implemented in a
subdirectory located here.  These include the following:

* base - implements the Stream class as a subclass of Inspector, handles
  stream configuration, provides entry point for Stream evaluation of a
  Packet, stream statistics management.

* tcp - implements module for handling Stream tcp sessions.  This includes
  normalization protocol tracking, normalization, and reassembly.

* udp - implements module for handling Stream udp sessions.  Tracking only.

* icmp - implements module for handling Stream icmp sessions.  Tracking
  only.

* ip - implements module for handling Stream ip sessions.  Tracking only.

* file - implements module for handling Stream file session.  This directly
  sets file data and invokes file processing and detection.

* user - implements module for handling Stream user session.  This handles
  payload only, eg from a socket.  Does splitter based reassembly like TCP.

HA functionality for each protocol (IP,ICMP,UDP, & TCP) is implemented in
./<protocol>/<protocol>_ha.*.  The static class <protocol>HAManager instantiates and
destroys the <protocol>HA class.  <protocol>HA is a subclass of ProtocolHA and interfaces
with the high level Stream HA functionality. <protocol>HA is instantiated in each packet
processing thread.

Note that the lifetime of any stream splitter instance should be less than the lifetime
of the corresponding inspector instance.
