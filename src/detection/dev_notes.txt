Rules are grouped by ports and services.  An MPSE instance is created for:

* protocol and source port(s)
* protocol and dest ports(s)
* protocol any ports
* service to server
* service to client

For each fast pattern match state, a detection option tree is created which
allows Snort to efficiently evaluate a set of rules.  The non-leaf nodes in
this tree reference an IpsOption instance.  The leaf nodes are OTNs, which
represents the rule body.  Attached to the OTN is one or more RTNs, which
represent the rule head.  There is one RTN for each policy in which the
rule appears.  (There is just one instance of each unique RTN in each
policy to save space.)  The RTN criteria are evaluated last to determine if
an event should be generated.

Note that the fast pattern detection code refers to qualified events and
non-qualified events.  The latter are just fast pattern hits for which
no rule fired.  The former are fast pattern hits for which a rule actually
fired.

Rules w/o fast patterns are grouped per the above and evaluated for each
packet for which the group is selected.  These are definitely bad for
performance.

The following was written by Norton and Roelker on 2002/05/15 and predates
the use of services but is still applicable.

*Fast Packet Classification for Rule and Pattern Matching in SNORT*

A simple method for grouping rules into lists and looking them up quickly
in realtime.

There is a natural problem when aggregating rules into pattern groups for
performing multi-pattern matching not seen with single pattern Boyer-Moore
strategies.  The problem is how to group the rules efficiently when
considering that there are multiple parameters which govern what rules to
apply to each packet or connection. The parameters sip, dip, sport, dport,
and flags form an enormous address space of possible packets that must be
tested in realtime against a subset of rule patterns. Methods to group
patterns precisely based on all of these parameters can quickly become
complicated by both algorithmic implications and implementation details.
The procedure described herein is quick and simple.

The methodology presented here to solve this problem is based on the
premise that we can use the source and destination ports to isolate pattern
groups for pattern matching, and rely on an event validation procedure to
authenticate other parameters such as sip, dip and flags after a pattern
match is made. An instrinsic assumption here is that most sip and dip
values will be acceptable and that the big gain in performance is due to
the fact that by isolating traffic based on services (ports) we gain the
most benefit.  Additionally, and just as important, is the requirement that
we can perform a multi-pattern recognition-inspection phase on a large set
of patterns many times quicker than we can apply a single pattern test
against many single patterns.

The current implementation assumes that for each rule the src and dst ports
each have one of 2 possible values.  Either a specific port number or the
ANYPORT designation. This does allow us to handle port ranges and NOT port
rules as well.

We make the following assumptions about classifying packets based on ports:

1. There are Unique ports which represent special services.  For example,
   ports 21,25,80,110,etc.

2. Patterns can be grouped into Unique Pattern groups, and a Generic
   Pattern Group

   a. Unique pattern groups exist for source ports 21,25,80,110,etc.
   b. Unique pattern groups exist for destination ports 21,25,80,etc.
   c. A Generic pattern group exists for rules applied to every
      combination of source and destination ports.

We make the following assumptions about packet traffic:

1. Well behaved traffic has one Unique port and one ephemeral port for
   most packets and sometimes legitimately, as in the case of DNS, has
   two unique ports that are the same. But we always determine that
   packets with two different but Unique ports is bogus, and should
   generate an alert.  For example, if you have traffic going from
   port 80 to port 20.

2. In fact, state could tell us which side of this connection is a
   service and which side is a client. Than we could handle this packet
   more precisely, but this is a rare situation and is still bogus. We
   can choose not to do pattern inspections on these packets or to do
   complete inspections.

Rules are placed into each group as follows:

1. Src Port == Unique Service, Dst Port == ANY -> Unique Src Port Table
     Src Port == Unique Service, Dst Port ==
     Unique -> Unique Src & Dst Port Tables
2. Dst Port == Unqiue Service, Src Port == ANY -> Unique Dst Port Table
     Dst Port == Unqiue Service, Src Port ==
     Unique -> Unique Dst & Src Port Tables
3. Dst Port == ANY, Src Port == ANY -> Generic Rule Set,
     And add to all Unique Src/Dst Rule Sets that have entries
4. !Dst or !Src Port is the same as ANY Dst or ANY Src port respectively
5. DstA:DstB is treated as an ANY port group, same for SrcA:SrcB

*Initialization*

For each rule check the dst-port, if it's specific, then add it to the dst
table.  If the dst-port is Any port, then do not add it to the dst port
table. Repeat this for the src-port.

If the rule has Any for both ports then it's added generic rule list.

Also, fill in the Unique-Conflicts array, this indicates if it's OK to have
the same Unique service port for both destination and source. This will
force an alert if it's not ok.  We optionally pattern match against this
anyway.

*Processing Rules*

When packets arrive:

1. Categorize the Port Uniqueness:

   a. Check the DstPort[DstPort] for possible rules,
      if no entry,then no rules exist for this packet with this destination.

   b. Check the SrcPort[SrcPort] for possible rules,
      if no entry,then no rules exist for this packet with this source.

2. Process the Uniqueness:

    If a AND !b has rules or !a AND b has rules then
       match against those rules

    If a AND b have rules then
        if( sourcePort != DstPort )
            Alert on this traffic and optionally match both rule sets
       else if( SourcePort == DstPort )
           Check the Unique-Conflicts array for allowable conflicts
           if( NOT allowed )
               Alert on this traffic, optionally match the rules
    else
        match both sets of rules against this traffic

    If( !a AND ! b )  then
        Pattern Match against the Generic Rules ( these apply to all packets)


*Pseudocode*

    PORT_RULE_MAP * prm;
    PortGroup  *src, *dst, *generic;

    RULE * prule; //user defined rule structure for user rules

    prm = prmNewMap();

    for( each rule )
    {
        prule = ....get a rule pointer

        prmAddRule( prm, prule->dport, prule->sport, prule );
    }

    prmCompileGroups( prm );

    while( sniff-packets )
    {
        ....

        stat = prmFindRuleGroup( prm, dport, sport, &src, &dst, &generic );
        switch( stat )
        {
        case 0:  // No rules at all
            break;
        case 1:  // Dst Rules
            // pass 'dst->pgPatData', 'dst->pgPatDataUri' to the pattern engine
            break;
        case 2:  // Src Rules
            // pass 'src->pgPatData', 'src->pgPatDataUri' to the pattern engine
            break;
        case 3:  // Src/Dst Rules - Both ports represent Unique service ports
            // pass 'src->pgPatData' ,'src->pgPatDataUri' to the pattern engine
            // pass 'dst->pgPatData'  'src->pgPatDataUri' to the pattern engine
            break;
        case 4:  // Generic Rules Only
            // pass 'generic->pgPatData' to the pattern engine
            // pass 'generic->pgPatDataUri' to the pattern engine
            break;
        }
    }
