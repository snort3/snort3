a flow event.

An example configuration follows:

    extractor =
    {
        protocols =
        {
            service = 'http',
            tenant_id = 1,
            on_events = 'eot',
            fields = 'ts, uri, host, method'
        }
        {
            service = 'http',
            tenant_id = 2,
            on_events = 'eot',
            fields = 'ts, uri'
        }
