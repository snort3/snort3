This directory contains the data logger framework and targeted service extractors.

Extractor is a global network inspector that logs flow data upon receiving
a flow event.

==== General Design

As one can notice from extractor's configuration, the targeted service and
events, filters and a set of fields are bound together as a single item of
`extractor.protocols` array. Configurations from different bindings do not
interfere. Among other things it allows tenants to get independent data
logging configurations.

The module's configuration scheme reflects how extractor works under the hood.
Global settings (like `formatting` and `output`) are configured just once.
While every logging rule in `protocols` array creates a new logging context,
a service extractor.

==== Logger

`ExtractorLogger` is a base class which accepts data from a service extractor,
transforms and pushes data further out of Snort. It has two purposes:

* formatting transformation
* writing to a configured destination

Formatting is performed within a given `ExtractorLogger` class.
Interface methods of the base class accept a fixed set of data types only.
Thus, every specialization of `ExtractorLogger` must know how to fit those
types in the targeted formatting. Namely:

* null-terminated string (`char*`)
* sub-string, without null symbol (`char*`, `size_t`)
* number (`uint64_t`)
* timestamp (`struct timeval`)
* IP address (`snort::SfIp`)
* flag (`bool`)

The idea is to keep this set to a bare minimum (so that a new specialization
won't need to support a large range of types). Yet, big enough to cover common
data types.

A log unit is a log record. It is enclosed by `ExtractorLogger::open_record` and
`ExtractorLogger::close_record` calls. A header (or a footer) can
be added. They prepend (append) the set of log records with meta info.

To printout formatted data the extractor utilizes `Connector` API, which allows
to transmit data using different pre-configured channels. Specific connector
is getting configured as a separate module and extractor accesses it by
name.

Both Logger and its Connector are allocated per thread, so no syncronization
is required. If data channel poses multithreaded output restrictions, those
should be handled by the Connector. `Connector` specialization may do things
in asynchronous way and store the data for indefinite amount of time, but only
if it was moved to it. Therefore, each logger should choose the appropriate
method for transmitting the message.

`ExtractorLogger` instance is global and shared among all `ExtractorEvent`
instances. Additionally, each `ExtractorService` has its own thread-local
service ID object obtained from the `ExtractorLogger`. The service ID object
is also utilized by the corresponding `ExtractorEvent` instances, although its
lifespan is controlled by the `ExtractorService`.

==== Logging Context

A processing unit of Extractor is a service extractor.
Each configuration entry in `extractor.protocols` array instantiates a service
extractor of `ExtractorEvent` type.

`ExtractorEvent` contains an entire logging context and does the following:

* subscribes to events of the targeted protocol (`service` and `on_events`)
* provides data field extracting functions
* accepts a configured set of fields for logging (from the module's parser)
* handles an event from data bus:
  ** writes data out immediately via `ExtractorLogger`
  ** accumulates data on the flow for further aggregation with subsequent events

Also, each specific class of a service extractor spawns a specific
`snort::DataHandler` (which is immediately subscribed to data bus events). The
handler memory is solely managed by data bus. It is guaranteed that service
extractor lives longer than a handler. This allows safe callbacks from event
handler to a service extractor. So, memory management is split between data
bus (event handlers) and the inspector (service extractors).

===== Logging Context Over Reload
With the memory management split between inspector manager and data bus, there
is a kind of overlap occurring during configuration reload scenario.

|===============================================================================
| Inspector | Data Bus | Flow and Flow Data
| **Before reload:**
  1st instance of extractor is active
| 1st event handler is alive and references to 1st instance
| events from a flow goes via 1st event handler right to 1st inspector
| **During reload:**
  2nd instance is created, 1st instance is moved to trash and loses its event handler
| 1st event handler is deleted completely, 2nd event handler becomes active
| flow is not ended, but packets are not processed here
| **After reload:**
  1st instance in the trash still may process callbacks from the original flow data,
  2nd instance sees new events and processes them, but using the original
  flow data; if 2nd instance swaps flow data (creates its own) it will start
  receiving callback from the new flow data
| 2nd event handler is active and redirects all events to 2nd inspector
| events from a flow goes to 2nd inspector, however if the original flow
  data persists the 2nd inspector has to deal with it
|===============================================================================


==== Filtering

Filtering helps to decrease the amount of traffic being logged. The goal is to
keep performance overhead low. The check action is performed as early as
possible, at the beginning of each event handling function.

Filtering may be performed by external modules or by extractor itself.
The module stores filtering results on the flow, so it becomes
cached for the flow. However, tenant ID filter is not cached.

To override extractor's filtering, an external module sets `ServiceType::ANY`
bit in the filtering item.

For `extractor.protocols` entries which don't set filtering items,
`extractor.default_filter` action is applied (until an external module
re-computes filtering for the flow).

*(IP and port filtering by extractor yet to be implemented)*

==== Extracting Data

Data path from an inspector up to a writing function should conform the
following targets:

* be performant (make the path short in terms of number of stack frames and
  other service function calls)
* be configurable (to adjust fields set for logging)
* be extensible, so that any new service/event/field can be added preserving
  all static/dynamic checks

The general path includes an inspector's protocol event, an event's getter
functions, data extracting functions, formatting and writing functions.

|===============================================================================
| Layer               | Data types       | Notes
| 1. Inspector        | (any type)       | generates an event (calling `DataEvent` constructor)
| 2. Data Event       | (any type)       | provides getter functions, resides in snort3/src/pub_sub/
| 3. Extractor Event  | `char*` `uint64_t` `timeval` `SfIp` `bool` | converts any type to a fixed type
| 4. Extractor Logger | `char*` `uint64_t` `timeval` `SfIp` `bool` | decorates a fixed type to fit formatting
| 5. Connector        | `ConnectorMsg`   | accepts an internal data type, which is an array of bytes of a given length
|===============================================================================

_Inspector layer_ focuses on performance. It means we seek a minimal overhead
on throwing an event (to add a bare minimum of new conditions and checks).
Also, an event's constructor stores a reference to inspector's processing
context. Ideally, it would be just inspector's flow data, which means no
savings in the event itself (since flow data can be retrieved directly from the
flow).

A _Data Event_ specialization implements getter methods. They can present a
general piece of aggregated data (say, a whole request or a transaction) or a
specific property (like, a flag from protocol's state). A getter may cache an
intermediate result of extra computations if any. Having _Data Event_
implemented as usual in snort3/src/pub_sub/*.cc is just fine. It doesn't
affect performance much (comparing to header-only implementation).

_Extractor Event_ extracts data from an event according to the configured set
of fields. `ExtractorEvent` class carries the following entities:

* a generic data type with an extract function, `DataField` template and its
  common instances define how to convert any type (a provided context) to a
  given fixed type:
    ** `const char*` for null-terminated strings
    ** `snort::SfIp` for IP addresses
    ** `uint64_t` for numbers
    ** `struct timeval` for timestamps
    ** `std::pair<const char*, uint16_t>` for sub-strings, which have just
       length without null symbol
* common extracting functions (IP address, port number, packet timestamp,
  etc.)
* a generic logging function, which can log a configured set of fields right
  out of the provided context (any type)

Template implementation of the generic data type `DataField`, its extracting
function `Ret (*get)(Context...)` and the logging function `log(const T& fields,
Context... context)` ensure:

* static type checks are performed during compilation and everything matches on the
  data path
* the data path is easily extensible with a new data type, context types,
  extracting or logging function (and customizable as well)

Since _Extractor Logger_ interface accepts just a limited set of (basic) types,
it should be able to decorate a data field and put it into a targeted format.

_Connector_ is the final layer before data leaves Snort. It may
implement output stream and external resource management (like, file
rotation, socket operations), synchronization, buffering, queuing if needed.

==== Flow Data

Extractor's flow data is a bit different from the usual approach for other
inspectors. There is a need to store multiple actual types on the flow. Each
service extractor may get its own context or no context at all.

`ExtractorFlowData` is the basic flow data type which:

* complies with snort's flow framework, which expects one `DataFlow` type per
  inspector
* can be easily extended with a new service simply by providing `ServiceType type_id`
  constant in the derived class
* does static and dynamic type checks
    ** if the underlying flow changes its service type, the actual type
       of flow data changes as well (both are `ExtractorFlowData`, but distinct
       derivatives)
    ** `T* ExtractorFlowData::get(snort::Flow* f)` method ensures that
       retrieved flow data is of the desired type
* the virtual destructor allows a derived class to make a final callback to
  the owning service extractor whenever the flow gets deleted (to make a
  partial log record of an incomplete or abandoned session)

Flow Data instance must bump reference count of the corresponding Extractor
inspector. This is to make sure that the inspector's extractor service
instance is always available for a callback from the flow data.

For reasons mentioned in Logging Context Over Reload section, flow data
content must be understood and processed properly (accepted or rejected) by
service extractors of different generations (before and after configuration
reload).
