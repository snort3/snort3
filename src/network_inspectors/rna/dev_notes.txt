This inspector is still in experimental (work-in-progress) state.

The Real-time Network Awareness (RNA) inspector provides visibility into a network using
Passive Network Discovery (PND). RNA analyzes traffic to discover hosts on the network
and to detect operating system (OS) running on a host. It uses fingerprints for OS detection.
It logs ip/mac addresses, ports, protocols, OS, and other information about traffic running
on these hosts. It does not generate or alter traffic on its own.

RNA logs information it discovers by parsing TCP/UDP/IP/Link-layer protocols and observing
data found by other inspectors (e.g., monitoring application IDs, client versions,
user-agents found by appid or http inspectors). Operating systems have different signatures
which are apparent in different parameters in the packets that it sends. These parameters
include things like TCP window sizes, TCP options, segment sizes, etc. Such fingerprinting
information is provided to RNA as input so that RNA can analyze traffic.

RNA discoveries is stored in host tracker objects, which are saved globally in an LRU cache
and shared among threads. RNA memory and discovery are bounded by the memcap of cache.

Packets from untracked sessions (e.g., non-IP) are processed via the eval method as per
proto-bit registrations. Packets from tracked sessions (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP)
are processed via events as per subscriptions. Since RNA needs to see the first packet
of a session published from stream trackers, these modules (e.g., stream, stream_icmp,
stream_ip, stream_tcp, and stream_udp) should be enabled whenever RNA module is enabled.

Currently, RNA only supports host discovery with filtering based on IP/port/zone. To enable
this (disabled by default), the config file referred by rna_conf_path can have keywords:
Analyze            # discover application, host, user (only host discovery is implemented)
AnalyzeHostUser    # discover application, host, user (same as Analyze)
AnalyzeApplication # discover application
AnalyzeHost        # discover application, host
AnalyzeUser        # discover application, user
portexclusion      # don't discover on this port

Format:
config keyword [!]ip [zone]
portexclusion dst|src|both tcp|udp port ip

Examples:
config AnalyzeHost 0.0.0.0/0 -1     # discover any ipv4 on any zone
config AnalyzeHost ::/0 2           # discover any ipv6 on zone 2
config AnalyzeHost !1.2.3.4/16 3    # exclude this ipv4 range on zone 3
config Analyze !cafe:feed::0/64     # exclude this ipv6 range on any zone
portexclusion dst udp 53 8.8.8.8    # exclude this ip for UDP port 53 in destination direction
portexclusion both tcp 4000 ::0/0   # exclude any ipv6 for TCP port 4000 in both direction

Note that exclusion has higher priority than inclusion. RNA does not support application/user
discovery, fingerprint, util_lib_path decoder, enable_banner_grab, etc. The enable_logger config
is to enable/disable sending RNA discovery events to EventManager::call_loggers. Such event logger
or reader is not implemented yet. However, since RNA stores host information into host_cache,
to log the discovered hosts into a file, one can
    1) issue socket command: host_cache.dump('file.out'), or
    2) add lua config: host_cache = { dump_file = 'file.out'}.
