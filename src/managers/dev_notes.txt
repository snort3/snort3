Managers provide the ability to instantiate and utilize the various plugins
in Snort++.  There is a separate manager class for each plugin type, plus
one for modules, plugins, scripts, and packets.

The only plugin that is reloadable is Inspector.  It has reference counts
so that it won't be freed while an active flow is using it.

Only the action, codec, and inspector managers have thread local state:

* action manager has an action function
* codec manager has the grinder and related stats
* inspector manager has a flag to control calling the clear method

Some Lua files are here as they are coupled closely with C++ code in this
directory (module_manager.cc):

* snort_config.lua provides the ability to parse a Lua configuration.  It
  is much easier to traverse the Lua tables via Lua itself.  This file
  leverages the LuaJIT FFI to open and close tables and set values.

* snort_plugin.lua provides FFI for script plugins (ips options and
  loggers).  This is pretty thin at the moment and should be expanded to
  provide more data.

These Lua files get installed in LUA_PATH.

Module manager recursively sets default values for all parameters within a
module.  While list items have default values, default lists are not
provided by modules; that is strictly done in Lua with snort_defaults.lua.
This not only simplifies the code somewhat, it also makes the most sense
from a user perspective.

The ConnectorManager (and associated) classes manage the set of Connector
objects.  One ConnectorCommon is created to incapsulate a vector of
configuration objects.  At thread startup, these config objects are used
to instantiate thread specific instances of each configured Connector.
