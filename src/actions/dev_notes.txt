IPS actions allow you to execute custom responses to events. Unlike loggers,
these are invoked before thresholding and can be used to control external agents
(including loggers).

IPS rules have an associated type that determines what kind of action they
trigger. The rule types defined in this module are:

* log pass alert drop block

It also defines 3 active responses:
* react reject rewrite

Reject performs active response to shutdown hostile network session by injecting
TCP resets (TCP connections) or ICMP unreachable packets.

React sends an HTML page to the client, a RST to the server and blocks the flow.
It is using payload_injector utilty. payload_injector should be configured when
react is used.

Rewrite enables overwrite packet contents based on "replace" option in the
rules. Note that using "rewrite" action without "replace" option will raise
the appropriate rule alert but will not overwrite the packet payload.
Rewrite/replace works for raw packets only.

Ips actions are all pluggable and implemented as subclasses of IpsAction action.
Each ips action instance has an instance of the active action that is used to
perform the active response.

IpsAction::exec represents the action taken by the ips actions after rule
evaluation during packet processing. This may include logging, alerting  marking
the packet as passed, etc. IpsActions::exec when called without the otn will do
the active action such as drop/block/reset without alerting/logging or marking
the packet as passed.

ActiveAction::delayed_exec is called during the post processing of a packet to
send active responses.
