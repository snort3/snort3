Standard IPS rule option such as "content", "pcre", "flowbits" etc..
(non-preprocessor specific) implemented as IpsOption subclasses.

Most of the IpsOptions can be built statically or dynamically.  Several,
however, such as content, are still tightly coupled with the code and can
only be built statically.  The code will hopefully evolve and eliminate
these cases.

Several options use RangeCheck to implement upper and/or lower bound
semantics.  The Snort 2X options had various implementations of ranges so
3X differs in some places.

The "regex" and "sd_pattern" options both use hyperscan for pattern matching.
Hyperscan is an "optional" dependency for Snort3; These rule options will 
not exist without satisfying that dependency.

Hyperscan documentation can be found online 
https://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference

The "sd_pattern" will be used as a fast pattern in the future (like "regex")
for performance. 

"replace" option has the following restrictions:
- Content and replacement are aligned to the right side of the matching
content and are limited not by the size of the matching content, but
by the boundaries of the packet.
- Be aware that after the match there should be enough room left for the
"replace" content in the matched packet. If there is not enough space
for the "replace" content the rule will not match.
- Only the first occurrence of the content will be replaced.
- "replace" works for raw packets only. So, TCP data must either fit
under the "pkt_data" buffer requirements or one should enable detection
on TCP payload before reassembly: search_engine.detect_raw_tcp=true.
