This directory provides the top-level application objects and services.
SnortConfig is used heavily throughout the code and should be updated so
that builtin modules can attach state in a generic but readily accessible
fashion.


On Analyzer states and commands:

The Analyzer life cycle is managed as a finite state machine.  It will start
in the NEW state and will transition to the INITIALIZED state once the object
is called as part of spinning off a packet thread.  Further transitions will
be prompted by commands from the main thread.  From INITIALIZED, it will go to
STARTED via the START command.  Similarly, it will go from STARTED to RUNNING
via the RUN command.  Finally, it will end up in the STOPPED state when the
Analyzer object has finished executing.  This can be prompted by the STOP
command, but may also happen if the Analyzer finishes its operation for other
reasons (such as encountering an error condition).  The one other state an
Analyzer may be in is PAUSED, which will occur when it receives the PAUSE
command while in the RUNNING state.  A subsequent RESUME command will switch
it back from PAUSED to RUNNING.  One of the primary drivers of this state
machine pattern is to allow the main thread to have synchronization points
with the packet threads such that it can drop privileges at the correct time
(based on the limitations of the selected DAQ module) prior to starting packet
processing.

Two other commands are currently available: SWAP and ROTATE.  The SWAP command
will swap in a new configuration at the earliest convenience, and the ROTATE
command will cause open per-thread output files to be closed, rotated, and
reopened anew.

On Control connections and management:

Remote control connections can be created using tcp sockets or unix sockets.
Each control connection (local and/or remote) has a request and shell
associated with it. The asynchronous control commands within the control
connection are blocking and control connections are not returned the shell prompt
until the control commands are completed.


Re THREAD_LOCAL defined in thread.h:

In clang, this code compiles (std::array has, for all intents and purposes,
a constexpr constructor). gcc, on the other hand has stricter requirements
for constexpr expressions (tested on gcc 4.8, 4.9, and 5) and the code will
not compile.  This article implies that at the very least, the clang
treatment is more up-to-date:

http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3597.html

In any case, it does not matter right now, because we are only defining
THREAD_LOCAL -> thread_local on compilers that do not support extern
declarations of variables with the GNU __thread attribute (AKA clang).  In
the future, we may want to consider making the code compatible with either
TLS attribute, independent of the compiler (and of course
__declspec(thread) for windows, whenever we cross that bridge).


Re Use of libhwloc in thread_config.cc:

The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) library provides a nice,
platform-independent abstraction layer for CPU and memory architecture
information and management.  Currently it is being used as a cross-platform
mechanism for managing CPU affinity of threads, but it will be used in the
future for NUMA (non-uniform memory access) awareness among other things.
