Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer is a stateful JavaScript whitespace and identifiers normalizer.
JSNorm is a basic implementation, so other modules can use it right away or provide some
customization to it. Normalizer will remove all extraneous whitespace and newlines, keeping a
single space where  syntactically necessary. Comments will be removed, but contents of string
literals will be kept intact. Any string literals, added by the plus operator, will be concatenated.
This also works for functions that result in string literals. Semicolons will be inserted, if not
already present, according to ECMAScript automatic semicolon insertion rules.

All JavaScript identifier names, except those from the ident_ignore or prop_ignore lists,
will be substituted with unified names in the following format: var_0000 -> var_ffff.
So, the number of unique identifiers available is 65536 names per transaction.
If Normalizer overruns the configured limit, built-in alert is generated.

A config option to set the limit manually:
 * js_norm.identifier_depth

Identifiers from the ident_ignore list will be placed as is, without substitution. Starting with 
the listed identifier, any chain of dot accessors, brackets and function calls will be kept
intact.
For example:
 * console.log("bar")
 * document.getElementById("id").text
 * eval("script")
 * foo["bar"]

Ignored identifiers are configured via the following config option,
it accepts a list of object and function names:
 * js_norm.ident_ignore = { 'console', 'document', 'eval', 'foo' }

When a variable assignment that 'aliases' an identifier from the list is found,
the assignment will be tracked, and subsequent occurrences of the variable will be
replaced with the stored value. This substitution will follow JavaScript variable scope 
limits.

For example:

    var a = console.log
    a("hello")  // will be substituted to 'console.log("hello")'
    a.foo.bar() // will be normalized as 'console.log.foo.bar()'. When variable is 'de-aliased',
                // following identifiers are not normalized, just like identifiers from ident_ignore

When an object is created using a 'new' keyword, and the class/constructor is found in ident_ignore
list, the object will be tracked, and although its own identifier will be converted to normal form
its property and function calls will be kept intact, as with ignored identifiers. 

For example:
    var obj = new Array()
    obj.insert(1,2,3) // will be normalized to var_0000.insert(1,2,3)

For properties and methods of objects that can be created implicitly, there is a
prop_ignore list. All names in the call chain after the first property or
method from the list has been occurred will not be normalized.

Note that identifiers are normalized by name, i.e. an identifier and a property with the same name
will be normalized to the same value. However, the ignore lists act separately on identifiers
and properties.

For example:

   js_norm.prop_ignore = { 'split' }

   in: "string".toUpperCase().split("").reverse().join("");
   out: "string".var_0000().split("").reverse().join("");

In addition to the scope tracking, JS Normalizer specifically tracks unescape-like JavaScript
functions (unescape, decodeURI, decodeURIComponent, String.fromCharCode, String.fromCodePoint).
This allows detection of unescape functions nested within other unescape functions, which is
a potential indicator of a multilevel obfuscation. The definition of a function call depends on
identifier substitution, so such identifiers must be included in the ignore list in
order to use this feature. After determining the unescape sequence, it is decoded into the
corresponding string, and the name of unescape function will not be present in the output.
Single-byte escape sequences within the string and template literals which are arguments of
unescape, decodeURI and decodeURIComponent functions will be decoded according to ISO/IEC 8859-1
(Latin-1) charset. Except these cases, escape sequences and code points will be decoded to UTF-8
format.

For example:

   unescape('\u0062\u0061\u0072')              -> 'bar'
   decodeURI('%62%61%72')                      -> 'bar'
   decodeURIComponent('\x62\x61\x72')          -> 'bar'
   String.fromCharCode(98, 0x0061, 0x72)       -> 'bar'
   String.fromCodePoint(65600, 65601, 0x10042) -> 'êÅÄêÅÅêÅÇ'

Supported formats follow

   \xXX
   \uXXXX
   \u{XXXX}
   %XX
   \uXX
   %uXXXX
   decimal code point
   hexadecimal code point

JS Normalizer is able to decode mixed encoding sequences. However, a built-in alert rises
in such case.

JS Normalizer's syntax parser follows ECMA-262 standard. For various features,
tracking of variable scope and individual brackets is done in accordance to the standard.
Additionally, Normalizer enforces standard limits on HTML content in JavaScript:
 * no nesting tags allowed, i.e. two opening tags in a row
 * script closing tag is not allowed in string literals, block comments, regular expression literals, etc.

If source JavaScript is syntactically incorrect (containing a bad token, brackets mismatch,
HTML-tags, etc) Normalizer fires corresponding built-in rule and abandons the current script,
though the already-processed data remains in the output buffer.

Enhanced JavaScript Normalizer has some trace messages available. Trace options follow:

* trace.module.js_norm.proc turns on messages from script processing flow.

Verbosity levels:
+
1. Script opening tag detected (available in release build)
2. Attributes of detected script (available in release build)
3. Normalizer return code (available in release build)
4. Contexts management (debug build only)
5. Parser states (debug build only)
6. Input stream states (debug build only)

* trace.module.js_norm.dump dumps JavaScript data from processing layers.

Verbosity levels:
+
1. js_data buffer as it is being passed to detection (available in release build)
2. (no messages available currently)
3. Payload passed to Normalizer (available in release build)
4. Temporary buffer (debug build only)
5. Matched token (debug build only)
6. Identifier substitution (debug build only)

PDF parser follows "PDF 32000-1:2008 First Edition 2008-7-1 Document
management Portable document format Part 1: PDF 1.7".
Known limitations:
* Nested dictionaries are not fully supported. Properties of the last object
  are tracked. Once the nested object ends, it clears all info about the object
  type.
* Nested dictionaries are not allowed in JavaScript-type dictionary.
* JavaScript in streams is tracked only when a reference to that stream is found
  earlier in that file.
* Compressed JavaScript streams are handled correctly only if PDF decompression is
  enabled (http_inspect.decompress_pdf = true, and the same option for other inspectors)
