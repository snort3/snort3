// It was added to make the rule timing selection easier:
// - if combined with header the rule should still be evaluated in both header and body.
// - if combined with body or trailer should be evaluated at body/trailer.
// PS_ERROR is used for invalid combination of sections:
// trailer and body sections can be combined only if it's a request trailer in a to_client direction
// When updating this enum, also update section_to_str
